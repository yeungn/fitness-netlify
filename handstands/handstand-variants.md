## Marion Push Up
Marion pushups are an intense, progressive form of decline pushup I learned in Marion Pen. Decline pushups are just pushups with your feet elevated—lifted up on something. If you lift your feet high enough, the pushups stop working the chest as much and start working the muscles at the front of the shoulders. In Marion these were a very popular cell exercise, and because the ten steps weren’t well known, guys used to use decline pushups as a transitional method to work up to handstand pushups. The popular system involved starting with fifty pushups. When a con could do fifty flat pushups, he put his feet on his bunk and built up to forty pushups. When he could do this, he put his feet up on the john—which is a little higher than a bunk—and did thirty pushups. Then he put his feet on the basin and did twenty pushups. Finally he jammed his feet up on the wall above the basin and did ten pushups. The cons left a little mark or smudge on the wall where there feet were, and every time they trained they tried to go a little higher, still doing ten pushups. Eventually the cons would be pretty much in a handstand position against the wall, doing ten full handstand pushups. Marion pushups are an interesting approach to inverse work, but in my experience they just don’t work as well as combining regular pushups and handstand pushups in a program using the ten steps. Use the ten steps and you’ll get powerful shoulders faster and more easily.

## Isometric Presses
Stand up straight with your open hands either side of your shoulders and your bent arms out wide, stretching your chest. Push your elbows as far back as you can; as if you were trying to crack a nut between your shoulder blades. Now powerfully tense all the muscles in your arms and torso. Exhale as you slowly push upwards, making your hands into tight fists as you go. Pause as your arms become straight, and contract as hard as possible for a count of two. Inhale as you reverse the movement of the way down, and repeat. Although this exercise uses a wide elbow position, it’s still quite safe because of the lack of external forces. It’s obviously difficult to quantify and measure progress in this exercise, although in a sense it is progressive because as your shoulders and their antagonistic structures become stronger over time, the opposing muscle groups are able to contract with increasing force. The same principle holds true for all isometric exercise. Isometric presses shouldn’t be the mainstay of your delt workout, but they certainly serve as an excellent toning technique and are good for the rotator cuffs. This technique also really burns the muscles up and gets a good sweat on when done slowly and for high reps.

## Windmills
Almost everybody has tried this great warm up exercise. Simply hold your arms out to the side and begin to make circles. This exercise is dynamic and requires more flexibility than most people realize, so don’t just start wildly swinging or you might tweak cold muscles. Start with small circles—no larger than a Frisbee—and as your shoulders begin to loosen gradually expand your rotations to the maximum of your range of motion. One set of fifty reps (i.e., fifty full circles) will warm up even the tightest upper body, but don’t forget to repeat the exercise for the same number of reps, circling in the opposite direction. A slightly harder variation is alternate windmills, which involves the arms circling in different directions before switching.

## Hand Walking
Once you are comfortable in free handstands, you’ll inevitably want to try walking around on your hands. Hand walking is difficult at first, but if you’ve gained good strength in the handstand position, all it requires is a little re-orientation to do it. Once you’ve got this trick, you’ll find you can walk around on your hands for extended periods without much effort. As a result, this exercise won’t build much strength. If you really want to try a grueling variation, try walking on your hands down some steps (use short stairs or start part way up so you won’t hurt yourself if you fall). When you can do this safely, walk up the stairs on your hands. That builds good strength.

## Tiger Bends
These are a classic upper body feat favored by the old-time strongmen because it displays balance and coordination as well as enormous strength. Get into a free handstand, away from the wall. Drop down flat onto your forearms, and hold for a moment. In this position your arms will resemble the forepaws of a big cat—hence the name (see photo next page). Now if you are strong enough, you can kick your legs up and hop back into the full handstand position, although this second part of the movement requires massive power. Tiger bends give the shoulder girdle a vigorous workout, but their primary effect is on the triceps, elbows and outer forearms. The master of this old technique will have elbows strong as titanium axles.

You won’t see it in today’s gyms, but mega-strength feats like the tiger bend were well known to old school masters of bodyweight training. Here the exercise is performed by the famous twenties strongman Sig Klein. Klein’s arms were so powerful that he could hold the average man overhead with one arm, and easily see-saw press 100 lbs. dumbbells—and all at a bodyweight of barely 154 lbs.
