## Short Bridges

Work up to: 3 sets of 50

### Performance
Lie on your back, with your legs stretched out and your hands crossed on your stomach. Draw your feet in, bending the knees until your shins are nearly parallel to the ground and your feet your feet are flat on the floor. The feet should be shoulder width apart or a little less, depending upon your frame. Your heels will be around six to eight inches from your buttocks. This is the start position. Press down through the feet, lifting the hips and back clear of the ground until only the shoulders and feet are supporting the bodyweight. At this point, your thighs, trunk and torso should form a straight line, with no sagging of the hips. This is the finish position. Pause in the top position for a moment, before reversing the motion, lowering your body back to the start position. Repeat the exercise for your target repetitions, exhaling as you go up, inhaling on the way down.

### Exercise
Short bridges involve pushing through the lower limbs, and are the gentlest way to begin spinal training because in everyday life we usually activate the spinal muscles via the legs. We do this simply by moving around, bending down, etc. The act of keeping the trunk straight at the top of the short bridging movement stimulates the spine and hip muscles with hardly any pressure running through the vertebrae. As a result this exercise is wonderful therapy for those who have suffered disc injuries.

### Perfecting Your Technique
Most people should be able to do short bridges without much difficulty. If you are recovering from a back injury and this exercise poses a problem, simply reduce the range of motion by performing the technique with a few pillows or cushions under the hips.

## Straight Bridges

Work up to: 3 sets of 40

### Performance
Sit on the ground with your legs stretched out in front of you. Your knees should be straight, with your feet about shoulder width apart. Place your palms on the floor on either side of your hips, with your fingers pointing towards your toes. Sit up straight. Your body will now form a right angle, with your trunk perpendicular to your legs. This is the start position. Press down through the hands, tensing the arms as you simultaneously push your hips upwards until your legs and torso form a straight line. Draw the chin up and look towards the ceiling. At this point your bodyweight will be passing through your palms and heels. This is the finish position. Pause before reversing the motion and repeating as necessary. Exhale as you press yourself up, inhale as you go down.


### Exercise
Short bridges require you to activate the spinal muscles mainly by pushing through the legs; straight bridges require pressure through the arms also. It’s this factor, combined with the elongated body position, that makes straight bridges slightly more difficult. The movement not only tones the arms, it also loosens the torso and strengthens the muscles between the shoulder blades that are crucial for performing harder versions of the bridge.

| Intermediate standard | 2 sets | 20 |
| Progression standard | 3 sets | 40 |

### Perfecting Your Technique
If the straight bridge described is too difficult, you can make the exercise easier by reducing the leverage. Instead of performing the technique with the legs straight, do it with the legs bent, as they are in short bridges. If this is still too difficult, simply perform the exercise kneeling down, leaning back and pressing the buttocks a few inches up and away from the calves. Continue using this partial motion until you get strong enough to try again.
Your body will now form a right angle, with your trunk perpendicular to your legs.
Push your hips upwards until your legs and torso form a straight line.

## Angled Bridges

Work up to: 3 sets of 30

### Performance
Angled bridges require an object which is about knee height or a little higher. In prison, a bunk is perfect. The average bed in an American home is a bit taller, but still acceptable for our purposes. Sit on the edge of the bunk or bed, and lie back with your feet flat on the ground. They should be approximately shoulder width apart. Shuffle forwards a little so that your hips are off the bunk, and place your hands either side of your head, with your fingers pointing towards your feet. This is the start position. Press down through the hands, straightening the elbows and pushing the hips up, arching your back as you do so. Continue smoothly pushing as far as you can, at least until your head and body are entirely clear of the bunk. The arms don’t need to be fully extended; the elbows will be bent. You may only lift up a few inches. That’s fine. Allow your head to tilt back under control, so that you can see the wall behind you. This is the finish position (fig 88). Reverse the motion, lowering yourself until your torso and head are resting completely on the bunk again. Repeat as necessary, breathing normally.

### Exercise
Angled bridges are the first exercise in the bridging series to utilize the full hands alongside head position used in advanced bridging. This position will strengthen the wrists and open up the shoulders and chest in preparation for later exercises. This motion also requires greater flexibility and contractile strength in the upper spine than the earlier steps.

### Training Goals

| Beginner standard | 1 set | 8 |
| Intermediate standard | 2 sets | 15 |
| Progression standard | 3 sets | 30 |

### Perfecting Your Technique
Bridging is easier the shallower the angle—i.e., the higher your head and hands are. If an angled bridge off a bunk is too hard, try it against something higher—maybe a table or desk—until you can manage the lower surface.

Angled bridges require an object which is about knee height or a little higher.
 The arms don’t need to be fully extended; the elbows will be bent.

## Head Bridges

Work up to: 2 sets of 25

### Performance
Lie with your back on the floor. Draw your feet in, bending the knees until your heels are approximately six to eight inches from your glutes. The feet should be shoulder width apart or slightly closer. Place the hands alongside the head, with the palms flat on the floor and your fingers pointing towards your toes. Your elbows should be angled towards the ceiling at this point. Now push the hips as high as you can, lifting the body from the floor. Continue pushing through your arms and legs until your back is well arched, and your hips are high. The head should be tilted down, with the crown of your skull pointing towards the floor. This is a bridge hold. Retain this position momentarily, before bending at the arms and legs until the top of your skull very gently touches the floor. This is the start position. Pause again briefly, before pushing yourself back up to the bridge. This is the finish position. Go carefully, so that you don’t bang your head. Maintain the deep arch in the back all the way throughout the set, breathing as normally as possible all the way through. When you have finished all your reps, smoothly lower your shoulders, back and hips to the floor.

### Exercise
Unlike yoga, which trains the back with static holds, old school calisthenics focuses on dynamic (or moving) strength. This short-range technique is only a preliminary step towards learning complete bridging movements

### Perfecting Your Technique
If you have some difficulty getting into the initial bridge hold, begin by lying with something under the small of your back—two or three cushions or pillows should do the trick. If 

you can’t touch your head to the floor, just use a shorter range of motion and go lower from workout to workout.
The top of your skull very gently touches the floor.
This is a bridge hold.

## Half Bridges

Work up to: 2 sets of 20

### Performance
This exercise will require a basketball or soccer ball to monitor your form. Sit down on the floor, placing the ball on the ground right behind you. Lay back so that you are lying down with only your shoulders and the soles of your feet on the floor. The feet should be shoulder width apart or a little closer, and the ball should be supporting the small of your back. If you find this position uncomfortable, lay a folded towel or cushion over the ball before you begin. Place the hands alongside the head, with the palms flat on the floor and your fingers pointing towards your toes. Now press through the hands, pushing your shoulders and head off the floor so that only the soles of your feet, the ball, and your palms are supporting your bodyweight. This is the start position. From here, push the hips as high as you can, extending the arms and legs and lifting the back up until it is well clear of the ball. Keep going until your back is fully arched. This is the finish position (fig, 92). Pause for a moment at the top, before lowering yourself slowly to the start position. After starting the set, only descend until the small of your back lightly touches the ball—don’t rest your bodyweight on it. Repeat, breathing as normally as possible.

### Exercise
This movement constitutes the top half of the range of Step 6, the full bridge. By the time you can perform this motion for the reps listed under the progression standard, your spinal muscles will be powerful and lithe enough to start including the more difficult lower half of the bridging movement.

### Perfecting Your Technique
As with most bridging movements, if you have trouble performing the reps as described, start shallow and build up your range of motion over time.
The feet should be shoulder width apart or a little closer, and the ball should be supporting the small of your back.

Keep going until your back is fully arched.

## Full Bridges

Work up to: 2 sets of 15

### Performance
Lie on your back. Draw your feet in, bending the knees until your heels are approximately six to eight inches from your glutes. The feet should be shoulder width apart or slightly closer. Place the hands alongside the head, with the palms flat on the floor and your fingers pointing towards your toes. Your elbows should be angled towards the ceiling at this point. This is the start position. Now push the hips as high as you can, lifting the body from the floor. Continue pushing through your arms and legs until your back is well arched, and your hips are high. In the perfect bridge, your arms will be totally straight. Allow the head to tilt backwards between the arms, so that you can look at the wall behind you. This is the finish position. Hold this top position for a moment, before reversing your motion. Control your descent—you will gain more benefit from the exercise if you lower yourself smoothly than if you simply collapse. Continue going all the way back down until your hips, back and head are resting completely on the floor again. This sequence constitutes one rep. Push yourself back up again for your target reps, breathing normally throughout.

### Exercise
The full bridge is a phenomenal exercise. As well as preventing and curing many back problems, it increases total-body flexibility, adds power to the deep muscles of the spine, expands the ribcage, limbers up the shoulders, tones the arms and legs, improves circulation and even aids the digestion.

### Perfecting Your Technique
Attaining the ideal bridge—particularly the full extension of the arms and legs—is difficult and requires patient practice. When you begin, simply push your body as high as you can. Perfection will come with time.

Place the hands alongside the head, with the palms flat on the floor and your fingers pointing towards your toes.

Allow the head to tilt backwards between the arms, so that you can look at the wall behind you.

## Wall Walking Bridges Down

Work up to: 2 sets of 10

### Performance
Stand approximately one arm’s length from a wall. If in doubt about your positioning, it’s better to stand closer to the wall than further from it—you can more safely adjust your position this way. Your feet should be about shoulder width apart. Push the hips forwards and begin bending backwards. Raise your chin, tilting your head back as far as is comfortable. Continue smoothly bending back until you can see the wall behind you. As soon as you can see the wall, raise your hands, moving them over your shoulders and placing the palms flat on the wall, fingers pointing down, level with your head. This is the start position. Shift some of your bodyweight back through your hands, and lower one by a few inches, before placing it securely on the wall again. Now follow suit with your opposite hand, lowering it even further on the wall. Keep bending backwards as you walk down the wall with your hands. As you move downwards, you will need to move slightly away from the wall to accommodate your body bend. Do this by taking mini-steps forwards any time you feel the need. Continue alternating this movement until you run out of wall. When this occurs, place your hands flat on the floor. At this stage you will be in a full bridge hold next to the wall. This is the bottom position. From here, simply lower your backside to the floor, and stand up. Return to the start position, and walk back down again. Breathe regularly as you go.

### Exercise
Walking down the wall is easier than walking up it. Master this step first.

### Perfecting Your Technique
Very few people manage to walk fully down the wall their first time. Just try to go lower every time you train. Smaller steps will make things easier.

Continue smoothly bending back until you can see the wall behind you.

Keep bending backwards as you walk down the wall with your hands.

Place your hands flat on the floor.

## Wall Walking Bridges Up

Work up to: 2 sets of 8

### Performance
This step begins when you are standing totally clear of the wall, with your back to it. From here, assume the start position you learned for walking down; bend backwards with your hands over your shoulders making contact with the wall. Then walk down the wall as described in Step 7, until you are in a full bridge hold next to the base of the wall. Now it’s time to go back up. This is done by reversing the movement. Place one palm back on the wall, pushing through it. Next, place your other palm above it. This transition whereby your palms go from the floor back onto the wall is the hardest part of the technique. Now simply place one palm above the other repeatedly as you go back up the wall. As your body straightens, you will probably have to take mini-steps back towards the wall to keep a healthy pressure going through your palms. Continue walking upwards until you are nearly straight). From here, push gently away from the wall until you are standing totally clear from it again). This cycle—standing, walking all the way down, walking back up, and standing free again—constitutes one single repetition of this exercise.

### Exercise
Once you have the flexibility and strength to walk down a wall, it’s time to master this step and walk upwards. This doesn’t require any extra flexibility, but it does require extra strength because you are moving against gravity.

### Perfecting Your Technique
As with Step 7, the key to perfecting this exercise lies in progressively increasing range of motion. When you first try it, only go down the wall to a point where you are sure you can hand walk back up. Mark this level with a piece of chalk if it helps. Simply increase the depth over time.
Place one palm back on the wall, pushing through it.

Continue walking upwards until you are nearly straight.
: Push gently away from the wall until you are standing totally clear from it again.

## Closing Bridges

Work up to: 2 sets of 6

### Performance
Stand up straight with your feet approximately shoulder width apart. The space behind you should be clear of objects for at least the distance of your height. This is the start position. Place your hands on your hips and begin pushing your pelvis forwards). When your pelvis is as far front as it will go, begin bending your knees as you simultaneously arch your spine backwards. Tilt your head back and look behind you as you go. This must all form one smooth movement. Continue this arching motion until you can see the ground a few feet behind you. As soon as you see the floor, take your hands off your hips and pass them back over your shoulders, beyond your head). This moving posture requires considerable flexibility, but you will find that the forwards shift of your hips combined with the bend in the knees prevents you from falling backwards. Extend your arms as you keep the movement going, until your palms are resting on the floor. This is the finish position, the full bridge hold3)

From here, bend the arms and legs until your back is on the floor. Now stand up into the start position again to begin your second repetition. Breath normally throughout the set.

### Exercise
This movement is the hardest bridging technique so far. It comprises the eccentric or negative phase of the Master Step, stand-to-stand bridges

### Perfecting Your Technique
At first, you will probably fall backwards over the last third of the movement, landing on the palms if you are lucky. This is unacceptable—you must continue practicing until you can 

gently place your palms on the floor. One trick that can help is reaching back onto stairs. Reach back onto lower steps each time you train until you are placing your palms on the ground.
: Place your hands on your hips and begin pushing your pelvis forwards.
: As soon as you see the floor, take your hands off your hips and pass them back over your shoulders.

Extend your arms as you keep the movement going, until your palms are resting on the floor.

## Stand to Stand Bridges

Work up to: 2 sets of 10-30

### Performance
Stand up straight and perform a closing bridge (Step 9) into a full bridge hold). From this position, shift your weight forwards through the thighs, and bend the knees as you straighten your arms. Continue gradually shifting your weight forwards as your press through the hands and finally the fingers, lifting the palms off the floor. At this point, provided your back is flexible enough to maintain a high arch, and your stomach is powerful enough, your fingers will leave the ground as you start to straighten yourself up). This upwards motion should be the consequence of a smooth forwards transfer of your bodyweight, not the result of an explosive push off the floor with the hands. Continue the movement, drawing your hands back over your shoulders and pivoting the neck up in line with the body. Finally, pull the hips in until you are standing straight with hands by your sides. This is the finish position). Going from standing up, down to a full bridge hold, then straightening yourself back up to the standing position again constitutes one full repetition. Repeat the exercise, breathing normally.

### Exercise
This is the ultimate bridging technique of the series. It requires incredible flexibility, strong joints, powerful muscles, balance and coordination. When performed regularly, stand-to-stand bridges increase agility, massage the internal organs, align the spine and muscular system and increase energy. When worked for high repetitions, they supercharge the metabolism.

### Perfecting Your Technique
Just as with closing bridges (Step 9), you can use stairs to increase your depth in this movement over time. Employing a very wide foot position will also be of help. Strive to use a shoulder width stance eventually, however.
: Perform a closing bridge (Step 9) into a full bridge hold.

Press through the hands and finally the fingers, lifting the palms off the floor.
: Finally, pull the hips in until you are standing straight with hands by your sides.
