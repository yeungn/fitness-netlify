## Knee Tucks

*Work up to: 3 sets of 40*

- Sit on the edge of a chair or bed. Lean back a little, grip the edge of the seat with your hands, and straighten your legs. Your feet should be together with the heels raised a few inches from the floor. This is the start position. 

- Smoothly bring the knees up and in until they are approximately six to ten inches from your chest. Exhale as you draw the knees in. By the time the motion is complete, you should have exhaled fully and your abs should be tightly contracted. This is the finish position. Pause for a count of one before reversing the motion and finishing again in the start position. 

- Inhale as you extend. Your feet should follow a straight line backwards and forwards, and should not touch the floor until the set is completed. Keep the stomach tucked in at all times. Resist the urge to pump out reps quickly. As with all waist techniques, take extra breaths between reps if you need to.

> ### Perfecting Your Technique
> This exercise is equally hard in the start position where the legs are stretched out—and in the finish position where the knees are pulled towards the chest. To make the exercise a little easier, focus on a shorter range of motion between these two extremes. As your waist becomes stronger, gradually lengthen the range of motion until your form is perfect.

## Flat Knee Raises

*Work up to: 3 sets of 35*

- Lie flat on the floor, with your legs together and your arms by your side. Bend your knees so that they are at approximately ninety degrees (i.e., a right angle), with the feet an inch or two off the ground. Pressing hard on the floor with your hands will help keep your torso stable. This is the start position. 

- Now smoothly bring your knees up over your hips, so that your thighs are perpendicular to the floor, and your calves are parallel to the floor. Keep the knees at a right angle throughout and exhale as you go, keeping your stomach muscles tight. This is the finish position. Pause for a count of one, before reversing the motion by extending your legs as you lower your feet. 

- Inhale as you return to the start position. After you begin, at no point throughout the movement should your feet touch the floor.

> ### Perfecting Your Technique
> One of the hardest elements of this exercise is keeping the feet off the floor with the legs outstretched. If this is causing you trouble, return your feet to the floor between repetitions. When you gain the strength to do reps while continuously keeping your feet off the floor, do so—even if it’s only two repetitions—then as you tire complete the set by resting your feet on the floor between reps. Over time keep gradually adding reps with your feet clear of the floor.

## Flat Bent Knee Raises

*Work up to: 3 sets of 30*

- Lie on your back with your legs together and stretched out on the floor. Your hands should be by your sides, and also in contact with the floor. Raise your legs, bending them at the knee approximately forty-five degrees from the straight alignment. Your feet should be kept an inch or two off the floor. This is the start position. 

- The positive portion of the exercise involves raising the legs and feet smoothly—over a count of two seconds—until the feet are directly above the pelvis. As you move, the angle of the knee should not change; it must remain locked in the same position. Pressing down on the floor with the hands will help you stabilize your torso throughout the movement. 

- Pause at the top, before reversing the motion. Pause again in the start position before repeating as necessary. Exhale as the feet move up, inhale as they are moving down. Keep the stomach tight at all times. The feet should not touch the floor at all during the set.

> ### Perfecting Your Technique
> Flat knee raises involve a ninety degree knee bend. Flat bent leg raises require a forty-five degree knee bend. The less the degree of bend, the greater the amount of leverage and the harder the exercise becomes. If you cannot meet the beginner standard, use more of a knee bend—a little less than ninety degrees. As you get stronger, start straightening your legs little by little, until you meet the forty-five degree criterion.

> As you move, the angle of the knee should not change; it must remain locked in the same position.

## Flat Frog Raises

*Work up to: 3 sets of 25*

- Perform the positive portion of the bent leg raise, but instead of pausing at the top, straighten your legs out fully. They should be perfectly straight, and perpendicular to the floor, so that your legs and torso form a right angle. This is the finish position. You should exhale throughout this two-part motion. 

- In most midsection work you would now reverse the movement; but not so here. Your muscles are stronger when lowering under resistance (because gravity helps), and frog raise techniques take advantage of this fact. Lower your legs, keeping them perfectly straight until they are an inch or two off the floor. In most exercises you should take about two seconds to go up and two seconds to go down. But for this exercise count four seconds down, to allow your body more work in the stronger position. Inhale as your legs slowly descend. Repeat.

> ### Perfecting Your Technique
> If you find this exercise difficult, focus your workouts on the top range—around the frog extension technique where the legs are up in the air. As you become stronger over time, slowly add depth until you are doing full reps.

## Flat Straight Leg Raises

*Work up to: 2 sets of 20*

- Lie on the floor, face up. Your feet should be together, your legs should be straight, and your arms should be by your sides. Lift your feet an inch or two from the floor. Pressing down with the hands will help you keep your torso stable. This is the start position. 

- Now, keeping your legs locked, raise your feet until they are directly above your pelvis. Exhale as you lift, keeping the stomach tight. It should take you at least two seconds to smoothly accomplish this—don’t explode up. Your legs and torso will form a right angle at this point. This is the finish position. Pause briefly, before reversing the motion exactly, inhaling as you go down. Pause again in the start position and repeat. At no point should allow your knees to unlock, and your heels shouldn’t touch the floor until the set is completed.

> ### Perfecting Your Technique
> This exercise can be made a lot easier by bending the knees; but that’s not an advisable shortcut because the major benefits of this exercise come from the fact that the legs are straight. If you can’t meet the beginner standard, go back to flat frog raises (Step 4) and build up to 3 sets of 30 reps before trying again. If you still have problems, keep the legs straight but focus on shorter, top range reps and acquire more depth whenever you are able to.

## Hanging Knee Raises

*Work up to: 2 sets of 15*

- Jump up and grab an overhead bar. Your hands should be about shoulder width apart. The bar needs to be high enough that your feet hang clear from the ground, even if only by an inch. Your body should be in a straight line, and you must keep your shoulders tight. This is the start position. 

- Bring your knees up smoothly until they are level with your pelvis and your knees are at a right angle. Your thighs will be parallel with the floor. Exhale during this motion, keeping your stomach pulled in. This is the finish position. Pause for a moment, then reverse the motion until your body is fully extended, inhaling as you go. Repeat.

> ### Perfecting Your Technique
> If you can’t handle at least five good, strict reps of this exercise, reduce your range of motion. Focus on the top portion where the knees are in the finish position, and gradually add depth over time. Whatever you do, resist the urge to use momentum. Using smooth, controlled motions early on in the series will build a base of muscle and tendon strength which will prove invaluable if you wish to master later steps. Momentum won’t help.

## Hanging Bent Leg Raises

*Work up to: 2 sets of 15*

- Grab an overhead bar so that your body is in a straight line and your feet are clear of the ground. Your hands should be approximately shoulder width, and your shoulders kept nice and tight. Now bend at the knees until your knee joints are angled off straight by around forty-five degrees. This will put your feet a few inches behind the rest of your hanging body. This is the start position. 

- Smoothly raise your legs at the hips until your feet are opposite your pelvis. This is the finish position. Pause and reverse the motion, before repeating. Only move at the hips; keep your knee angle locked into place. Exhale as you raise your legs, inhale as you lower them. Keep the abs tense.

> ### Perfecting Your Technique
> At first, you may find it difficult to keep your knees locked at the correct angle throughout the motion. There will be a tendency to straighten the legs out a little as you lower them. Try to avoid this, because resetting the correct angle as the legs are raised tends to impart momentum which leads to a swinging motion. If you have trouble with the exercise from the start, simply increase the angle of the knee bend from forty-five degrees to closer to ninety degrees. As you gain strength from workout to workout, gradually extend the legs until you meet your goal of forty-five degrees.

## Hanging Frog Raises

*Work up to: 2 sets of 15*

- Assume a start position identical to hanging bent leg raises, and raise your legs just as you would for that same exercise. Once you reach the top position with your feet in line with your hips, extend your feet out in a line directly away from you, so that your legs are perfectly straight. This will put your locked legs level with the floor, and your upper and lower body at a right angle. Pause for a moment, but do not reverse the motion. Instead, lower your legs while keeping them locked out perfectly straight. Finish with your body fully extended before assuming the start position again and repeating for the desired number of reps. Exhale as the legs are going up, inhale as they are going down, and keep the stomach tucked in at all times.

> ### Perfecting Your Technique
> If you can meet the progression standard for hanging bent leg raises, five reps of hanging frog raises should be well within your capabilities. When students have difficulty moving from bent leg raises to frog-type movements, the issue is usually lack of flexibility rather than strength. This can be easily cured by bending forwards and stretching out the lower back and hamstrings for a few minutes before attempting this exercise.”

## Hanging Partial Straight Leg Raises

*Work up to: 2 sets of 15*

- Hang from an overhead bar, with your body in a straight line and your feet off the floor. Tighten the shoulders. Lift the locked legs until they are at a forty-five degree angle, and hold. This is the start position. Keeping your knees locked straight, smoothly raise your legs until they are parallel with the floor. This is the finish position. Pause for a moment, before lowering the legs back to a forty-five degree angle. Repeat. Exhale as your legs move up, inhale as they move down. Keep the abs tight.”

> ### Perfecting Your Technique
> If you have met the progression standard for hanging frog raises, this means you will be able to hold the advanced legs extended position of the leg raise (fig. 80). If you find that partial straight leg raises are too hard, it must be because the range of motion is still too great for your strength levels. Focus on doing this exercise near the legs extended finish position, moving your legs down and back up, even if you can only move a few inches at first. Over time, your strength will increase and you’ll be able to move your legs down to the full forty-five degree position and back up again.

## Hanging Straight Leg Raises

*Work up to: 2 sets of 15*

- You know the drill by now! Take hold of an overhead bar which is high enough to leave your feet a short distance from the floor when your body is extended. Your hands should be approximately shoulder width apart. Ensure that the shoulders are tight. This is the start position. 

- Smoothly—over the course of at least two seconds—raise your legs until they are parallel with the floor. Exhale as your legs rise, blowing all the air you can out of your lungs so that the abdomen is fully contracted. This is the finish position. 

- Pause, before reversing the motion perfectly for at least another two seconds until you are back in the start position. Inhale as you go. Remain flexed, even in the start position. Your legs must stay locked at all times and you must use pure muscular control; no momentum allowed.

> ### Perfecting Your Technique
> When you begin hanging straight leg raises, you should have already mastered hanging partial straight leg raises. If you haven’t, go back and do so. If you have mastered the partial version, all you need to do is slowly increase your depth of motion from workout to workout—even by a fraction of an inch—and you’ll be able to pull off this exercise before you know it.
