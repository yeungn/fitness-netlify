### Sit Ups

A classic yet simple exercise which works the entire midsection and hips. 

- Lie on the floor, hook your feet under something sturdy and bend at the hips. 

The sit-up has got a bad rap as being dangerous for the spine, but if you bend well at the knees this is a total fallacy. Don’t put your hands behind your head, or you can strain the ligaments in your neck. 

Instead, put your fists to your temples and come up until your elbows touch your knees. I’ve read a lot of garbage saying that sit-ups don’t work the abdomen, but whoever writes this junk obviously isn’t doing sit-ups. 

A few hundred reps of this beauty will make your abs deliciously sore the next day, from sternum down to pelvis. The real drawback to sit-ups is that you adapt to them quite quickly, so to increase strength people are usually forced to add weight. If you don’t want to get into using weights, you can always progress over time to harder variations of the sit-up, like Janda sit-ups, incline sit-ups and Roman chair sit-ups

### Janda Sit Ups

Janda sit-ups are named after the Czech scientist who invented them. They are identical to normal sit-ups, with the exception that you press down hard on the floor with the soles of your feet throughout the exercise, while clenching your glutes and hamstrings as tightly as you can. 

The thinking behind this says that doing your sit-ups this way takes the hip flexors out of the movement because the hip flexors are anatomically opposite the glutes and hamstrings. The underlying theory is called reciprocal inhibition. Proponents of this theory argue that if the glutes and hamstrings fire, the hip flexors can’t fire—therefore the load is shifted onto the abdominals, which get stronger as a result. 

I’m pretty dubious about these claims. For a start, it’s not actually true that contracting a set of muscles prevents the opposite set of muscles from contracting (the phenomenon known as Lombard’s Paradox, is a good example. Besides, why would you want your hips to stop working? The abdomen and hip flexors have evolved to work in unison, and if you develop one part of a system without simultaneously training the corresponding parts, you are asking for trouble. 

That said, Janda sit-ups are a useful addition to your training arsenal, not due to reciprocal inhibition, but because the isometric contraction required forces the muscles of the midsection work more intensely than they normally would. Once you can do more than fifty regular sit-ups, try Janda sit-ups

### Incline Sit Ups

These require a board or platform you can elevate at one end. Hook your feet under the straps and do your sit-ups. As they get easier, lift the end of the board under your feet by a few degrees. This forces the midsection to work harder against gravity. If you have something high enough to secure the board on, you can keep going until you are almost vertical.

### Roman Chair Sit Ups

Roman chair training is a more intense modification of incline sit-ups. Hook your legs under something that will also support your thighs, so you can hang backwards with nothing supporting your torso or hips. 

Doing sit-ups from this position means that your midsection has to exert much greater force to control the trunk in the bottom position; you can also go back further than in regular or incline sit-ups, so the range of motion is increased. This exercise was a favorite in the golden days of American bodybuilding, from the thirties to the fifties. If you look back to photos of guys from those days—men like Zabo Koszewski or Leo Robert—you’ll see that the lifters back then had incredibly well-built midsections, both tighter and more muscular than modern drug-built champs. 

The technique usually requires a special apparatus, but not always. In prison we would sit and lower ourselves sideways over a chair while another guy held our feet. I’ve seen guys in the ghetto jump up and hook their legs through a basketball hoop to do Roman chair work! I wouldn’t recommend this, but it does go to show that where there’s a will, there’s a way. If you are resourceful, the whole world can be your gym.

### Twisting Sit Ups

This is the regular sit-up, but done with a twisting motion on the way up so that your elbow makes contact with the opposite knee, alternating the twisting direction with each repetition. 

A lot of bodybuilders (and boxers—who should know better) do this exercise in the hope of strengthening the obliques, the muscles at the side of the waist. 

Unfortunately there is very little force required to turn the torso during sit-ups, and as a result this variation adds little to the regular sit-up. Soviet trainers got wise to this fact decades ago and created a much more effective exercise for the twisting muscles of the waist; the Russian twist.

### Russian Twists

Get into a Roman chair, or any position where your torso is horizontal and free of support. Grab a weight—in the gym a lot of guys use a 45 lbs. plate, but in the pen we liked a heavy book or water bottle in each hand—and incline your trunk slightly. 

Hold the weight at arm’s length, and twist from left to right. Your arms (and therefore your waist rotation) only need to go from about the ten o’ clock to the two o’ clock position. You’ll know when you get this movement right, because the muscles to the sides of your abs will start to burn like crazy. It’s hard to make this exercise progressive, but it’s a fun variation to throw into your workouts once in a while

### L-Holds

Sit on the floor with your legs locked out in front of you and your arms by your sides. Now press down hard though your hands, so that your butt and legs come fully clear of the floor. Your legs should remain at a perfect right angle to your torso. 

You’ll need strong lats and arms to push your bodyweight clear of the floor, and your abs, hips and thighs need to contract hard or your legs will sag down. 

This exercise resembles the final position of the hanging straight leg raise, but it’s not as effective for the abdomen because of the lack of motion. The absence of the hanging position also means the ribcage and serratus get less work than in the hanging exercises. It’s a cool little trick though

### Medicine Ball Work

In the old days, athletes used to rely heavily on the medicine ball to train their waists, but this has largely gone the way of the dinosaur. 

It’s a shame, because throwing and catching a heavy ball works all the internal muscles of the midsection, like the diaphragm and transversus. It forces the abs to contract quickly and powerfully in the way they need to fire when bracing for a fall or protecting the internal organs from a stout punch. 

You don’t need a heavy authentic medicine ball, a basketball will do if you throw it hard enough. You don’t even require a training partner you can just shoot that sucker at a wall and catch it on the rebound.

### Side Leg Raises

Lie on your side on the floor. Keeping your leg straight, raise your uppermost leg as high as you can. Ninety degrees is ideal, but this will be difficult at first as the side of the hips are usually pretty feeble unless you are into skating or martial arts. Once you have built up to fifty reps, try the same exercise standing, which is much harder. 

A weighted alternative to this technique is the side bend with a barbell behind the neck or with a dumbbell in one hand, but I wouldn’t recommend using external weights while bending to the side as it puts the lower vertebrae in a precarious position. 

Modern books on exercise usually recommend side waist work, such as lateral crunch variations and twisting movements. In fact, the leg raise series works the entire waist including the obliques, and makes the hips good and strong. You really don’t require extra “sid exercises if you work hard on the leg raise ten steps. But if you do wish to specialize this area for whatever reason, forgo all other exercises and gradually build up towards twisting leg raises

### Twisting Leg Raises

This is the ultimate specialist exercise for the flanks of the torso, but you need to be pretty strong to even attempt it. Build up to it with side leg raises, and by working your way through the regular leg raise series. Hang from a bar, and raise your legs. They should be fairly straight. 

At the top of the movement, turn one hip out to the front and twist the pelvis up as high as you can. Reverse the motion before repeating on the other side. One set of this exercise—when you are up to it—will do more than a thousand sets of side crunches or broomstick twists. It’ll make your obliques stand out like fingers, and improve all your athletic twisting motions, taking your torque strength to stellar levels. This is because it’s big, intense and painful. 

Like the man used to say, you can tap a stick of dynamite with a pencil a thousand times, and it won’t go off. But hit it once with a hammer, and BANG! It’ll detonate. The same is true of muscle cells. Just making them contract over and over won’t make anything happen. They certainly won’t become any bigger or stronger. That’s why those electrical ab stimulation gizmos don’t work—all they do is make the muscles contract repetitively. You need to force your muscles to respond. Hit those pesky muscle cells with a hammer—jump up and grab a bar for leg raises, son!
