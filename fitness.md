## Strengthening the Core

If you cannot perform the hollow-hold, your back will arch
because your abs are weak, so it’s really important you work on this!

Click here to understand the hollow body position and get a rock solid core

First, I want you to understand what we mean by the hollow body position. Normally, your spine has many curves like this…
Look at all those [natural] curves.
Look at all those [natural] curves.

But in a STRAIGHT handstand we want the spine (notably the lower back) to be flat like this as much as possible. We literally want the bones stacked on top of each other so the muscles don’t have to do as much work. That’s how handstands can become effortless for hand-balancers.

flat back posture
To help achieve this flat back, we must recreate “Posterior Pelvic Tilt” (PPT) in the hips:
recreate
Anterior tilt will make your butt stick out and your back arch. Posterior will make your bones stack up perfectly.

Standing Drill: While standing normally, wildly exaggerate posterior pelvic tilt (PPT) by squeezing your glutes to tuck your tail bone under.  You want to make it such that your booty is not sticking out whatsoever. (Chronic PPT is sometimes called “no ass syndrome.”) Look in the mirror while you do this. I don’t care how big your butt is, if your butt is sticking out, make it such that you have a completely flat ass. When you go into the hollow hold on the floor or in a wall-handstand, you’re going to want to replicate this same tilt. It’s kind of confusing when you’re upside down, that’s why it’s nice to do this drill while you’re standing. If you do it correctly in a wall handstand and peel your feet off the wall, you should feel your balance is a lot better! The bones stack up just right!

Now, to strengthen your ability to hold this position, do these bodyline drills on the floor…

Holding the posterior pelvic tilt (PPT) while upside down takes a lot of ab strength. The following bodyline drills work very well for waking up your core and getting it ready for handstands.  In the video, I hold each position for 60sec so you could hold them with me and increase your ability to hold full body tension. Pay particular attention to the hollow hold as it will strengthen your abs the most and it’s the same PPT position you’re going to replicate while upside down.

- [Bodyline Drills with Antranik](https://youtu.be/44ScXWFaVBs)

The hollow hold teaches you how to flatten your lower back with the use of your glutes and abs while you lay on the floor.  The glutes help to tilt the hips and the abs are what help to flex the spine (opposite of spinal extension; arching), so you need to master the hollow hold to produce rock solid tension in that area. You will find it is the most difficult of the bodyline drills!

Now, remember how I just said that holding that posterior pelvic tilt while upside down takes a lot of ab strength?  Well, I lied. It takes an INSANE amount of ab strength to stay rock solid in a freestanding handstand!

So in actuality, you’re going to need to do an exercise that stresses your core much more than hollow holds exercise. For this reason, I recommend that after you master the hollow hold, start working on dragon flags. In a dragon flag, you’ll be trying to maintain that posterior pelvic tilt, except this time, your butt will be in the air as well, which will get your core strong enough for the rigors of handstands. Begin with slow, negative dragon flags:  Here is my tutorial for that:

### PARALLETTES HANDSTAND

1. Place your parallettes near a wall. Grip them so your hands are positioned approxi- mately 6-8 inches from the wall.
2. With your elbows fully locked, kick your legs into the air until your heels come to rest against the wall. If you’re having trouble kicking up, it can help to think about getting your hips over your hands rather than focusing on your legs. Either way, don’t let your elbows bend.
3. Hold this position,then come down as gently as possible. With continued practice you will learn to rely less on the wall until you are able to perform a freestanding hand- stand.

TRAINER TALK:
- Many people will find it helpful to look in between their hands while performing this hold, though others will prefer to keep their head in a neutral position.
\
- The farther your bars are from the floor, the harder you will need to kick in order to get into position.

---

### PARALLETTES HANDSTAND PUSH-UP

1. Begin in the handstand position.
2. Look in front of your hands. Bend your arms and carefully lower your head toward the ground. Do not allow your elbows to flare out to the sides.
3. Pause briefly before your head touches the ground,then press yourself back to the top. Make sure to keep your hips directly above your shoulders the whole time. You may need to arch your back a bit in order to facilitate the full range of motion, however, aim to keep any arching to a minimum.

TRAINER TALK:
- If you aren’t able to lower yourself all the way down, you can start with a par- tial range of motion.
\
Muscles Emphasized: Deltoids, Traps, Pecs, Triceps, Abs
- With continued practice you can gradually rely less on the wall until you are able to perform a freestanding handstand push-up.

### RINGS L-SIT

1. Begin in a support hold above the rings.
2. Keep your arms locked as you carefully raise your legs straight out in front of your body, forming a shape like a capital letter “L”. Press down into the rings, point your elbow pits forward and allow your upper back to round slightly so that you can spread your shoulder blades apart, being mindful not to let your shoulders shrug up toward your ears.
3. You may point or  ex your toes. Either way make sure your feet remain engaged. You may  nd yourself swinging or shaking a bit on your  rst attempts. This is normal and should minimize with practice.

TRAINER TALK:
- For an added challenge, try rotating your palms forward. \

---

### V-SIT

1. Grab your parallettes with your torso upright and your shoulders and hips directly above your hands. Your feet will be  at on the  oor with your knees bent.
2. Press down into the handles,point your elbow pits forward and allow your upper back to round slightly so that you can spread your shoulder blades apart, being mindful not to let your shoulders shrug up toward your ears.
3. Lift your feet off  the floor, extending your legs up and away from your body. You will need to lean your torso back and hips forward in order to raise your legs higher. The shape of your body will resemble a capital letter “V”. You may point or flex your toes. Either way make sure your feet remain engaged. You may find yourself swinging or shaking a bit on your first attempts. This is normal and should minimize with practice.

TRAINER TALK:
- Focus on getting your hips farther in front of your hands in order to facilitate
lifting your legs higher.
\
- If you aren’t able to perform the exercise with both legs fully extended, you can try bending one or both knees.

---

### MUSCLE-UP

1. Set the rings overhead and grasp one in each hand using an overhand false grip. It can help to stand on an elevated surface in order to set your grip before beginning your first rep.
2. Reach your legs forward and begin pulling your hands toward your armpits while driving your elbows down and back. Keep your body as stable as possible and do your best to avoid using momentum.
3. Once the rings are below your shoulders, push your chest and shoulders in front of your hands so your knuckles wind up facing the ground. Then extend your arms to complete the rep. Reverse the movement pattern to come back to the start position.
 
TRAINER TALK:
- Allow the rings to rotate as you move through the transition phase.
- If you are struggling with this exercise,
it can help to practice a “negative mus-
cle-up” by slowly lowering yourself
\
Muscles Emphasized: Forearms, Lats, Pecs, Deltoids, Rhomboids, Biceps, Triceps, Abs
down through the transition phase from the support hold, similarly to how you practiced negative pull-ups in Level 1.

### BACK LEVER
1. Begin in an inverted hang, looking toward the  oor.
2. Carefully start lowering your body toward a face-down horizontal position. Pitch your chest forward as you descend so your hands wind up behind your lower back. Shift your gaze forward as you get closer to parallel to the ground.
3. Squeeze your arms close to your sides as you continue lowering your body until you are completely horizontal. Engage your abdominals in order to minimize any arching of your back. Aim to form as straight of a line as possible. You can experiment with di erent hand positions. Most people will  nd that palms facing upward is less di - cult than palms facing the ground.

TRAINER TALK:
- If you are unable to perform the full movement with both legs fully extended, you can regress the exercise by bending one or both knees and tucking your leg(s) toward your chest.
\
Muscles Emphasized: Lats, Biceps, Pecs, Deltoids, Rhomboids, Low Back, Glutes, Abs
- Once you can hold a full back lever, you can try lifting into position from the bottom of a skin-the-cat, rather than lowering yourself down from an inverted hang.

---

### FRONT LEVER
1. Begin in an inverted hang, looking toward your toes.
2. Carefully start lowering your body into a face-up horizontal position, while simul- taneously leaning back from your upper body so the rings wind up above your hips. Make sure your arms remain straight.
3. Squeeze your arms close to your sides as you continue lowering your body until you are completely horizontal. Engage your abs in order to minimize any bend at the hips. Aim to form as straight of a line as possible.

TRAINER TALK:
- If you are unable to perform the full movement with both legs fully extended, regress the exercise by bending one or both knees and tucking your leg(s) toward your chest.
\
- Once you can hold a full front lever, you can try lifting into position from a standard hang, rather than lowering yourself down from an inverted hang.

---

### ONE-ARM ELBOW LEVER

1. Begin in the standard elbow lever position.
2. Slowly shift your weight toward the hand that is beneath your hip. Reach your free arm away from your body to help balance, gradually taking weight away from it.
3. With enough practice, you will eventually be able to remove your secondary hand entirely. Make sure to practice on both sides in order to keep things even.

TRAINER TALK:
- When starting out, it’s generally best to keep your feet spread apart. Once you can balance on one hand, try bringing your legs closer together to make it more di cult.
- As you get closer to the full expressi\on of the exercise, try practicing with your secondary arm farther from your body to help shift more weight to your primary arm. You can also practice with your assisting hand directly on the ground.
