## Neck Circles

1. Turn your head all the way to the right and drop your chin toward your shoulder.
2. Rotate your chin toward your chest, then all the way to the left.
3. Continue rotating until youâ€™re looking up, then complete the circle by coming back to your right shoulder.

  - Look in the direction that you are moving. Leading with your eyes can help you achieve a greater range of motion.
  - Go slowly to avoid getting dizzy and make sure to repeat evenly in both directions.
</div>
