## Elbow Corkscrew

1. Stand with your feet wider than hip distance, then bend over and grasp your parallettes with your knees slightly bent.
2. Protract your shoulder blades away from each other and depress them down away from your ears. At the same time, squeeze the bars, extend your arms and turn your elbow pits as far forward as possible.
3. Relax briefly, allowing your shoulder blades to retract together while you rotate your elbow pits inward toward one another, then return to the previous position.

  - Focus on the connection between your shoulder blades and your arms. Spreading your shoulder blades apart should  ow seamlessly along with locking your elbows and turning your elbow pits forward.
  - This position with your elbows locked, shoulder blades protracted and depressed, and elbow pits facing forward comes up often in parallette training. This exercise helps you learn how to properly engage the necessary muscles.
