1. Grasp the rings at chest height, then reach your arms all the way out to the sides.

2. Step one leg forward with your chest in front of the rings and lean your weight into your hands. This will produce a stretch along the front of your shoulders and chest.

3. Hold for approximately 30 seconds, then repeat with the opposite leg in front. Avoid excessive arching of your back; the idea is to focus on opening your chest and shoulders.

  - Experiment with various hand positions; overhand and underhand grips are both bene cial. You will feel the stretch differently each way.
