## Deep Squat Wrist Roll

1. Assume a wide stance with your toes turned outward to approximately 45 degrees, then squat down as deep as you can without lifting your heels from the  oor. You may need to  ex your ankles and allow your knees to drift toward your toes in order to achieve full depth. Aim to touch your hamstrings against your calves.
2. Bring your elbows inside your hips and clasp your hands together with your fingers interlaced and palms facing each other.
3. Keep your arms relaxed in front of your chest as you begin to exand extend your wrists in a circular motion, rolling your hands up, down, in and out. After several repetitions in both directions, reverse which hand is interlaced on top and repeat.

  - Be careful not to let your knees cave inward. You can wedge your elbows against your knees to keep them in line with your feet.
