## Overhead Reach

1. Grasp the rings at chest height, then reach your arms all the way overhead.
2. Step one leg forward with your chest below your hands and lean your weight into your hands, producing a stretch along your upper back, shoul- ders and chest.
3. Hold for approximately 30 seconds, then repeat with the opposite leg in front. Avoid excessive arching of your back; the idea is to focus on opening your chest, shoulders and upper back.

  - Experiment with various hand positions; over- hand and underhand grips are both fair game. You will feel the stretch di erently each way
