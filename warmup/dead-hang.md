1. Set the rings overhead and grasp one in each hand with a standard grip, with your feet off the ground.

2. Allow your shoulders to relax and shrug upward. Every part of your body should be relaxed other than your grip. It may help to think about reaching your arms upward while simultaneously reaching your toes toward the floor.

3. Hold for approximately 30 seconds, breathing deeply and allowing your spine to decompress.

  - Experiment with different head positions. You can look up, down or to the sides.
  - If your rings arenâ€™t high enough to hang with your feet completely off the ground, you may rest your heels on the floor with your feet positioned slightly in front of your body.
