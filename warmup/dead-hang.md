## Dead Hang

1. Set the rings overhead and grasp one in each hand with a standard grip, with your feet o  the ground.
2. Allow your shoulders to relax and shrug upward. Every part of your body should be relaxed other than your grip. It may help to think about reaching your arms upward while simultaneously reaching your toes toward the  oor.
3. Hold for approximately 30 seconds, breathing deeply and allowing your spine to decompress.
 
<div class="code-example" markdown="1">
  - Experiment with di erent head positions. You can look up, down or to the sides.
  - If your rings arenâ€™t high enough to hang with your feet completely o  the ground, you may rest your heels on the  oor with your feet positioned slightly in front of your body.
