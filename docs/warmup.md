### Neck Circles

1. Turn your head all the way to the right and drop your chin toward your shoulder.

2. Rotate your chin toward your chest, then all the way to the left.

3. Continue rotating until you’re looking up, then complete the circle by coming back to your right shoulder.

<div class="code-example" markdown="1">
  - Look in the direction that you are moving. Leading with your eyes can help you achieve a greater range of motion.
  - Go slowly to avoid getting dizzy and make sure to repeat evenly in both directions.

### Deep Squat Wrist Roll

1. Assume a wide stance with your toes turned outward to approximately 45 degrees, then squat down as deep as you can without lifting your heels from the floor. You may need to flex your ankles and allow your knees to drift toward your toes in order to achieve full depth. Aim to touch your hamstrings against your calves.

2. Bring your elbows inside your hips and clasp your hands together with your fingers interlaced and palms facing each other.

3. Keep your arms relaxed in front of your chest as you begin to exand extend your wrists in a circular motion, rolling your hands up, down, in and out. After several repetitions in both directions, reverse which hand is interlaced on top and repeat.

<div class="code-example" markdown="1">
  - Be careful not to let your knees cave inward. You can wedge your elbows against your knees to keep them in line with your feet.

### The Titanic


1. Grasp the rings at chest height, then reach your arms all the way out to the sides.

2. Step one leg forward with your chest in front of the rings and lean your weight into your hands. This will produce a stretch along the front of your shoulders and chest.

3. Hold for approximately 30 seconds, then repeat with the opposite leg in front. Avoid excessive arching of your back; the idea is to focus on opening your chest and shoulders.

<div class="code-example" markdown="1">
  - Experiment with various hand positions; overhand and underhand grips are both bene cial. You will feel the stretch differently each way.
</div>

### Overhead Reach

1. Grasp the rings at chest height, then reach your arms all the way overhead.

2. Step one leg forward with your chest below your hands and lean your weight into your hands, producing a stretch along your upper back, shoulders and chest.

3. Hold for approximately 30 seconds, then repeat with the opposite leg in front. Avoid excessive arching of your back; the idea is to focus on opening your chest, shoulders and upper back.
 
<div class="code-example" markdown="1">
  - Experiment with various hand positions; overhand and underhand grips are both fair game. You will feel the stretch differently each way

### Elbow Corkscrew

1. Stand with your feet wider than hip distance, then bend over and grasp your parallettes with your knees slightly bent.

2. Protract your shoulder blades away from each other and depress them down away from your ears. At the same time, squeeze the bars, extend your arms and turn your elbow pits as far forward as possible.

3. Relax briefly, allowing your shoulder blades to retract together while you rotate your elbow pits inward toward one another, then return to the previous position.

<div class="code-example" markdown="1">
  - Focus on the connection between your shoulder blades and your arms. Spreading your shoulder blades apart should flow seamlessly along with locking your elbows and turning your elbow pits forward.
  - This position with your elbows locked, shoulder blades protracted and depressed, and elbow pits facing forward comes up often in parallette training. This exercise helps you learn how to properly engage the necessary muscles.

### Dead Hang
1. Set the rings overhead and grasp one in each hand with a standard grip, with your feet off the ground.

2. Allow your shoulders to relax and shrug upward. Every part of your body should be relaxed other than your grip. It may help to think about reaching your arms upward while simultaneously reaching your toes toward the floor.

3. Hold for approximately 30 seconds, breathing deeply and allowing your spine to decompress.
 
<div class="code-example" markdown="1">
  - Experiment with different head positions. You can look up, down or to the sides.
  - If your rings aren’t high enough to hang with your feet completely off the ground, you may rest your heels on the floor with your feet positioned slightly in front of your body.

### Plank Knee Raise

1. Grasp your parallettes with your body fully extended and toes on the ground like the top of a push-up. Keep tension in your abs, legs and glutes while maintaining a straight line from your heels to the back of your head.

2. Carefully lift one leg in the air and raise your knee as far toward your chest as possible. Pause brie y with your foot still o  the ground, and then return to the start position.

3. Repeat with the opposite leg, being mindful to stay in complete control of your movement.

<div class="code-example" markdown="1">
  - You might be surprised by how much you feel your abs the first time you try this exercise. Anytime you remove a contact point during a plank, your abs will have to pick up the slack.
