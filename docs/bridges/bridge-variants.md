### Bow Holds
“This is a classic spinal exercise that will develop the contractile ability of your back, as well as training the vertebrae and their surrounding ligaments. Lie face down on the floor. Bend your knees, bringing your feet up over your buttocks, and reach back to grasp your ankles with their corresponding hands. This in itself will provide a stretch, but we’re not done yet. Using pure spinal power, simultaneously lift your chest and knees as high off the ground as you can. Hold the position for between ten and thirty seconds. Once you are comfortable in the bow hold, you can try the camel hold.”

### Camel Holds
“Kneel on the floor with your knees a few inches apart. Rather than sitting down on your calves, raise yourself up so that your hips are straight and your body forms an “L” shape. From this position, slowly arch your spine back and reach behind you to grasp your ankles. Once you have hold of them, push your hips forwards, maximizing the bend in your spine. Although this sounds easy, it requires some strength in the deeper spinal muscles to complete the position. Hold for ten to thirty seconds. I learned this nifty stretch from a yoga guy living on the West Coast. Nobody seems to know why it’s called the “camel”—looks nothing like a camel to me.”

### Gecko Bridge
“These are a slightly harder variation on the full bridge. Simply get into the full bridge hold (fig. 90), and lift one hand and the opposite foot from the floor, pointing these limbs out horizontally. Hold the position briefly, before supporting yourself with all your limbs again, and alternating the position with the other hand and foot. This requires more limb strength than regular bridge holds, and also firms up the lumbar muscles which have to tense very strongly to maintain balance.”

### Hyperextensions
“This is one of the few exercises I advocate which requires a training partner. Lie face down on a table, desk or high bench, so that your legs are resting on the surface up to your pelvis, but your torso is hanging straight down. Your trunk and legs will form a right angle at the hips. To maintain this position, you’ll need somebody to push down on your ankles so you don’t fall off. A cushion or wrapped up towel under your hips is also a good idea to prevent the edge of the table from cutting into you. Place your hands behind your head, and raise your torso until it is level with your legs. Hold this position for a moment before lowering yourself back down again and repeating for high reps. Hyperextensions work the hamstring complex, the glutes, the hips and spinal muscles. It’s a handy exercise to know, because it trains all these muscles without transmitting any pressure down through the spinal column. Guys who have ruptured or partially dislocated their discs by doing heavy deadlifts and squats will be able to train their back muscles with this exercise without aggravating their existing injuries.”

### Reverse Hyperextensions
“Hyperextensions involve keeping the legs stable and lifting the torso, with the hips being the major axis, or pivot. It stands to reason that you can work similar muscles by reversing this dynamic, by keeping the torso stable and lifting the legs, with the hips once again being the pivot point. To do this, you’ll have to lie face down over a table or desk—width-wise is usually best—with your torso and face on the desk and your legs off the end. (Because the legs are longer than the torso, they will probably touch the floor. That’s fine.) Grab the table whichever way you can to keep your torso secure, and raise your legs up behind you until they form a line with your trunk. Keeping your legs as straight as possible will make the exercise harder. Hold the position at the top briefly, before allowing your feet to descend under control. Repeat for high reps. I have found that big, couch-style armchairs make an excellent reverse hyperextension unit—drape yourself sideways over the chair, with your hips over one padded arm and your chest on the other, as you reach down to hook a hand under the chair for stability. Try this if you have a comfy chair at home—unfortunately bunks and beds just aren’t high enough to make the technique worthwhile. Reverse hyperextensions confer all the benefits of regular hyperextensions with the added plus that this variation doesn’t require a partner. The exercise is of real therapeutic value to athletes with bad backs, because it increases circulation and tone in the lower back without the usual accompanying strain.”

### Prone Hyperextensions
“Lay face down on the floor with your feet close together and your hands behind your head. Simply lift your chest and feet as high as you can, without bending the knees. In reality you will only be able to move your extremities a few inches, but this is an excellent exercise for the spinal muscles. Repeat for high reps, or go for ten to thirty second holds—whatever floats your boat. Because of the minimized leg motion in this version of the hyperextension, the hamstrings, gluteal muscles and hips don’t get nearly as much work as the spinal erectors. I’ve personally found this to be a very therapeutic exercise for working out those little kinks in the mid-back region we all get from time to time. This is also a brilliant exercise to refresh the back if you have to hunch over a desk at work, and because it’s quite gentle it can be done several times a day if you like. Placing your arms straight out in front of you (as if you were flying) will make the exercise slightly more difficult, due to leverage.”

### Back Handsprings
“It seems inevitable. At some point during the bridging series, as your back gets more flexible and you become adept at bending over backwards, you will probably begin to wonder if you could make a back handspring. You know the stunt—you’ve probably seen it in movies often enough. Jump up and flip back, briefly planting your hands on the floor before landing on your feet, agile as a cat. How cool is that? In fact, the urge to explore this move is no bad thing; as well as looking damn sweet, the back handspring is in many ways the plyometric counterpart of bridging—it allows you to train your spinal muscles, hips and legs in a more explosive manner than bridging does, and it has the benefit of forcing the entire body to act in a rapid, athletic fashion. Actually, once your hips and spine are loosened up from bridging, learning the back handspring isn’t all that hard. Provided you are fast and follow through, even heavy guys can pull it off. I’ve seen chubby martial arts star Sammo Hung perform the technique many times, well into his forties. The real key to the move is confidence. The first time I ever tried to do a back handspring, I nearly brained myself because I chickened out half way through. This was on concrete, and the experience drained my confidence even further. When you first learn, it’s a good idea to practice on thick foam mats if you get the chance. Back handsprings are a lightning fast move that need to be experienced to really be understood, so describing how to do them is kind of artificial, but I can at least give you a few pointers. Jump hard, but don’t jump up; jump up and back. Coordinate your arms with the movement, swinging up, overhead and back as fast as you can. Arch your back tight and keep your head back between your arms, looking for a place to plant your hands. When you find one, continue swinging your legs as momentum carries you over. Once you have mastered the back handspring, you might want to try the backflip—which is the same move, but without placing the hands on the ground (see the photo below). This requires much more explosive leg and spine powerful abs to tuck the knees up and over. It’s a brilliant exercise which will lead on to other tricks like wall flips, flash kicks (i.e., overhead flip kicks), twisting flips and so on, if you wish to explore these kind of moves in your training.”

“An athlete performs a backflip. Notice the arch of the back required for proper execution—this is impossible without powerful spinal muscles.
