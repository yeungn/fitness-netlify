## Wall Push Ups

Work up to 3 sets of 50, then begin the next step

### Performance
Face the wall With your feet together, place your palms flat against the wall. This is the start position. Your arms should be straight and shoulder width apart, with the hands at chest level. Bend the shoulders and elbows until the forehead gently touches the wall. This is the finish position. Press back to the start position and repeat.


### Exercise
Wall pushups are the first step of the ten step series required for complete mastery of the pushup family of movements. As the first step, this technique represents the easiest version of the pushup. Every able-bodied person should be able to do this exercise without a problem. Wall pushups are also the first movement in the therapy sequence of the pushup series. This exercise will be of great benefit to somebody coming out of an injury or following an operation, who is looking to promote healing and rebuild their strength slowly. The elbows, wrists and shoulders—most notably the delicate rotator cuff muscles within the shoulders—are particularly prone to chronic and acute injury. This exercise gently activates these areas, stimulating them, developing blood flow and tone. Beginners new to calisthenics must start any training program very gently to develop their technique and ability. They should start with this exercise.

### Perfecting Your Technique
Every person reading this book should be able to do this exercise, unless they are disabled, badly injured or ill. If coming back from an injury or operation, this movement is a good “tester,” allowing the athlete to feel out any weak points during rehabilitation.

## Incline Push Ups

Work up to 3 sets of 40, then begin the next step

### Performance
To do this exercise you will need to find a secure object or piece of furniture which is about half your height—it should reach the midpoint of your body (roughly around the level of the hips). Good options might be desks, tall chairs, work surfaces, kitchen tops, low walls or solid fences. In most prisons, I’ve found that the cell basin fits the bill nicely—but make sure it’s strong enough to accommodate the demands of the exercise. With your feet together and your body aligned, lean over and grasp the object with the arms straight and shoulder width apart. This is the start position of the exercise and—if the object reaches your midpoint—should put you at about 45 degrees from the floor. Bending at the elbows and shoulders, lower yourself until your torso gently touches the top of the object. Pause briefly before pressing back up to the start position, and repeat.

### Exercise
This exercise continues where Step 1 (the wall pushup) leaves off, with the lower pressing angle meaning that more bodyweight has to be moved by the muscles of the upper body. The incline pushup easier than the classic full pushup (Step 5). For most athletes this exercise won’t place very great demands on the muscles, but it will be useful for the beginner to continue their training gently, or for rehabilitation purposes.

### Training Goals

### Perfecting Your Technique
Incline pushups should be done at 45 degree angle. If the beginner standard can’t be met at this angle, use a greater (more upright) angle—simply place the hands on an object higher than the body’s midpoint. Once this is mastered, gradually use lesser angles until 45 degrees becomes easy. Harder angles can be attempted using progressively lower steps on a set of stairs.

## Kneeling Push Ups

Work up to 3 sets of 30, then begin the next step

### Performance
Kneel on the floor with your feet together, and your palms flat on the ground in front of you. The arms should be straight, shoulder width apart, and in line with your chest. Link one ankle around the other, and keep the hips straight and in alignment with the trunk and head. Using the knees as a pivot, bend at the shoulders and elbows until your chest is approximately one fist’s width from the floor. Pause and press back to the start position, then repeat.

### Exercise
Kneeling pushups are Step 3 in the pushup series. They are an important movement for beginners to master, because they are the easiest type of pushup that can be performed prone, i.e., flat on the floor. Because of this, they form an important link between the first two steps, which are performed standing, and the harder prone techniques later in the series. Women often do kneeling pushups because they lack the relative upper body strength to perform the full pushup, but this exercise offers great benefits to guys as well. It’s a good starting exercise for somebody who’s maybe overweight or kneeling pushups make an excellent warm up exercise you can do before attempting harder forms of pushup.

### Training Goals

| Beginner Standard: | 1 set | 10 |
| Intermediate Standard | 2 sets | 15 |
| Progression Standard | 3 sets | 30 |

### Perfecting Your Technique
If you find it impossible to perform full kneeling pushups, lessen your range of motion. Don’t go all the way down to a fist width from the ground. Use a higher number of reps (about twenty) over a shorter range of motion you can perform comfortably, then workout by workout (keeping the reps high) gradually keep adding an inch of depth until the full movement is mastered.

## Half Push Ups

Work up to 2 sets of 25, then begin the next step

### Performance
From the kneeling position, place your palms on the floor and stretch your legs out behind you. Your hands should be shoulder width apart, and directly below your upper chest. Your feet and legs should be kept together. 

Tighten your supporting muscles, so that your back, hips and legs stay locked in line. Starting with the arms straight, lower yourself approximately half the length of your extended arms, or until your elbows form a right angle. 

An excellent way to establish how far to descend is to use a standard basketball or soccer ball. Position yourself over the ball at the top of the movement, so that the ball is directly below your hips. 

Bend at the shoulders and elbows until your hips lightly make contact with the ball. On most people, this will be a good, objective indicator of the correct bottom position. Pause before pressing forcefully back to the start position.

### Exercise
The half pushup is an important exercise to master properly. You see a lot of guys doing pushups incorrectly, with their butt moving up as they bend at the hips. They do this because their waist and spinal muscles are weak. This exercise trains the waist and spine to keep the hips locked and aligned.


### Training Goals

| Beginner standard | 1 set | 8 |
| Intermediate standard | 2 sets | 12 |
| Progression standard | 2 sets | 25 |

### Perfecting Your Technique
If you can’t do half pushups, shorten your range of motion until you are able to perform the technique as given above. If you are using a basketball to monitor your form, position yourself so that it’s under your knees rather your hips. If you lower yourself from the arms extended position until your knees make contact with the ball, this will approximately equal a quarter pushup. Once you can do more than ten quarter pushups, position the ball a little higher up your thighs each time you practice until it is under your hips.

## Full Push Ups

Work up to 2 sets of 20, then begin the next step

### Performance
From the kneeling position, place your palms on the floor and stretch your legs out behind you. Keep your thighs and feet together, and ensure that the hands are below your upper chest and shoulder width apart. Straighten the arms. The hips and spine should be in line. Bend at the elbows and shoulders until your breastbone comes to within a fist’s width from the floor. In prison pushup competitions, a “counter” clenches his fist pinky side down on the floor, and counts out when the athlete’s chest touches the knuckle of his thumb. If you’re training alone and you wish to keep to the right depth, place a baseball or tennis ball directly below your chest. As your chest kisses the ball, pause and push up.

### Exercise
This technique is the “classic” pushup, the exercise most of us will remember from gym class. It’s a fair guess that if you say the word “pushup” to most people, they will naturally picture the full pushup. The full pushup is an excellent upper body exercise, working the arms, chest and shoulder girdle in an efficient manner. It’s by no means the hardest form of pushup, however; in terms of difficulty it only represents Step 5 in a series of ten.

| Intermediate standard | 2 sets | 10 |
| Progression standard | 2 sets | 20 |

### Perfecting Your Technique
You might be surprised how many people—even big, strong guys—cannot do full pushups properly. If you are in this group, return to half pushups using a basketball. If you have graduated from Step 4, you will be able to perform twenty-five reps with the ball under your hips. Gradually move the ball a few inches forward every workout, or whenever you can—keeping the reps the same. When you can go from the arms straight position to a bottom position where your jaw touches the ball, attempt the full version again.

## Close Push Ups

Work up to 2 sets of 20, then begin the next step

### Performance
Begin this technique in the same top position as full pushups (Step 5), but with the hands touching. You don’t need to overlap the hands or form a “diamond” between the thumbs and index fingers; it is sufficient for the tips of the index fingers to touch. From the straight arm start position (fig. 11), lower yourself until your chest gently touches the backs of your hands (fig. 12). Pause briefly before pressing back to the start position.

### Exercise
Close pushups are as old as the hills. They’re a vitally important exercise in the pushup series, but are often overlooked in favor of flashier techniques like plyometric (clapping) pushups and decline pushups. This is a tragedy, because the close pushup is an essential tool to help you in your journey to mastering the one-arm pushup. Most athletes have trouble with the one-arm pushup because they find it difficult to press themselves up from the bottom position, when the arm is bent most acutely. This is because their elbows are weak when bent beyond a right angle. Because of the placement of the hands during close pushups, the athlete naturally bends his elbows to a greater degree to reach the bottom position than is the case with full pushups. This increased elbow flexion trains the triceps and strengthens the tendons of the elbow and wrist. As a result, athletes who have become comfortable with this movement will find one-arm pushups much more manageable when the time comes.

| Intermediate standard | 2 sets | 10 |
| Progression standard | 2 sets | 20 |

### Perfecting Your Technique
If you cannot do close pushups with the hands touching (as described above), simply return to full pushups, and move the hands an inch or two closer every workout, keeping the reps quite high.

## Uneven Push Ups

Work up to 2 sets of 20, then begin the next step

### Performance
Get into the classic pushup position; feet together, legs, hips and back aligned, and arms straight with the palms on the floor beneath your upper chest. With one arm firmly supporting you, place the other hand on a basketball. Both your hands should be directly below your shoulders for stability. This is the start position. Once you have found your balance, do your best to evenly distribute your weight through both hands. At first this will not be easy, but persevere. Bend at the elbows and shoulders until your chest touches the top of whichever hand is on the ball. Pause briefly before pressing back up to the start position.

### Exercise
This is the first of the advanced pushup exercises that will take the athlete from double arm pushups to the single arm variety. You can use stable objects—like bricks or a cinderblock—instead of a basketball, but the basketball is best. The act of stabilizing the ball brings the seldom-used rotator cuff muscles into play, strengthening them for the more intense exercises to come. You can use a sturdy soccer ball rather than a basketball, but a classic basketball is king because its tacky surface helps the palm grip.

| Intermediate standard | 2 sets | 10 (both sides) |
| Progression standard | 2 sets | 20 (both sides) |

## Half One Arm Push Ups

Work up to 2 sets of 20, then begin the next step

### Performance
Get into the half pushup top position, with a basketball located below your hips, as described in Step 4. Place one hand on the floor beneath your breastbone with your arm straight and your other hand in the small of your back. This is the start position. Bend at the shoulder and elbow until your hips reach the top of the basketball. Pause and press back to the start position. If your triceps is weak, you’ll have a tendency to twist your torso as you move. Don’t—the whole body should be kept straight. This is true for all pushups.

### Exercise
Half one-arm pushups are Step 8 of the pushup series of movements. With this technique, the athlete finally moves from bilateral (two-sided) exercises to unilateral (one-sided) work. This is an important stage in the series. Working on half one-arm pushups will teach the athlete the balance and positioning necessary to master full one-arm pushups. Because only one limb transmits the moving forces, this exercise will also prepare the hand, wrist and shoulder joints for subsequent steps. Half one-arm pushups are an essential exercise in the series, and must be mastered for the reasons given above.

However, the elbows are not required to bend very greatly in this exercise, so it must never be performed by itself as the sum total of any pushup program. It should always be followed with a movement where the elbows are bent beyond ninety degrees in the bottom position; either close pushups or uneven pushups should be added afterwards.

## Lever Push Ups

Work up to 2 sets of 20, then begin the next step

### Performance
Get into a pushup position, with your body aligned and supported by the feet and one hand flat on the floor directly below your breastbone. Place your free hand on a basketball which is out to the side of the body. It should be as far away as you can reach while keeping your palm flat on the ball. Both your arms should be straight. Slowly, and under full control, lower yourself down until your chest is one fist’s width away from the floor. As with full pushups, you can use a baseball or tennis ball to check your depth if you are training alone. The act of lowering yourself will cause the basketball to roll out further to your side. Pause briefly in the bottom position, then push yourself back up.

### Exercise
The lever pushup, when performed properly, is very nearly as difficult as the one-arm pushup. This is precisely why this exercise forms such a useful penultimate step in the series. You will find that the arm on the ball can contribute very little force, due to its position stabilizing the ball away from the body—this forces the non-ball arm to work very powerfully. If you are not yet strong enough to come out of the bottom position of the one-arm pushup, you can use this exercise to gently assist yourself until you get there.

### Training Goals

| Beginner standard | 1 set | 5 (both sides) |
| Intermediate standard | 2 sets | 10 (both sides) |

### Perfecting Your Technique
It’s difficult to apply much force with the arm out straight, due to leverage. To make the exercise easier, bend the elbow of the arm on the basketball, bringing the ball closer to your body. Don’t go too far—bringing it all the way under your body will transform this exercise into Step 7, uneven pushups. As you get stronger over time, gradually move the ball out away from your body until you can do the exercise with a straight arm.

## One Arm Push Ups

Ultimate Endurance 1 set of 100

### Performance
Kneel on the floor, with one palm out on the ground directly in front of you. Stretch your legs out behind you, until they are straight and supported by the toes. Keep the spine and hips aligned, and shift your bodyweight so that your supporting arm goes straight down below your chest—not out to the side or in front of you. Once you are stable, place your non-supporting hand in the small of your back. Bend at the shoulder and elbow, lowering yourself under full control until your jaw is approximately one fist width away from the floor. Pause momentarily, before pressing back up to the start position.

### Exercise
The one-arm pushup when performed with pure form, is the gold standard of chest and elbow power, and it’s an impressive sight to see. Many athletes claim to be able to do this exercise without any problems, but don’t be fooled. When you ask them to put their money where their mouth is, their pushups are a joke—they splay out their legs, twist their torsos into ugly shapes to make the exercise easier, and violently “strain for shallow reps on wobbly, weak arms. Without doubt, the true master of the one-arm pushup is a rare beast. Make sure you become one of this endangered species.

### Perfecting Your Technique
If you have mastered the lever pushup, the one-arm pushup shouldn’t be too intimidating. But if you have trouble doing five reps of the one-arm pushup in good form, go back to Step 9, and ensure that you are can use perfect form for twenty repetitions of the lever pushup. If you can do this but still have trouble with the one-arm pushup, keep working with lever pushups until you can do thirty repetitions, before trying again.
