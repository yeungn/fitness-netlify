## Wall Headstand

Work up to: 2 minutes

## Performance
Find a solid wall. Place a pillow, cushion or folded towel down by the base of the wall. This will be for your head. Get on your hands and knees, and place the top of your head on the cushion. Your skull should be between six and ten inches from the wall. Set your palms down securely on either side of your head, about shoulder width apart. Bring your strongest knee up close to your corresponding elbow, and straighten out your other leg so the knee is off the ground (fig. 107). Now, push down hard with your strongest leg, as you simultaneously kick your other leg up in the air so that both legs dynamically move up towards the wall. Once you have found the wall, slowly straighten your legs so that the body is aligned (fig. 108). Keep the mouth closed and breath smoothly though the nose. After you have remained up for the required time, bend the legs and bring them down under control.

## Exercise
For anybody who wishes to approach the handstand pushup, the first specific skill which must be mastered is the inverse position—being upside-down. Wall headstands are the perfect introduction to this skill. With just a small amount of practice, the blood vessels and organs of the torso and head become accustomed to the sudden reversal of gravity. During headstands, the entire body is above the head, which means that the balance is tested. The shoulders also receive some work as stabilizers.

## Perfecting Your Technique
Most people can stay in the wall headstand for a few seconds—the major problem is getting up there in the first place! The difficulty is in learning the right level of pushing/kicking strength required to find the wall. If you find this difficult, ask a friend to help guide your legs up until you get it.

## Crow Stand

Work up to: 1 minutes

## Performance
Sit down on your haunches with your knees apart. Place your palms on the floor in front of you, at approximately shoulder width distance apart. Your arms should be bent a little. Lean forwards, placing your knees securely on the outside of your elbows (fig. 109). Now gradually continue tipping yourself forward, placing more and more weight through your palms and correspondingly less through your feet. Eventually the point of balance will shift, and your feet will lose contact with the ground. Hoist the legs up tight and balance for the required time, breathing steadily (fig. 110). When you are finished, reverse the movement by gently tipping your weight backwards until your toes come into contact with the floor again.

## Exercise
Crow stands will teach you to combine arm and shoulder strength with balance. They are an essential step in moving towards handstand pushups because you are supporting the entire bodyweight by balancing with the arms. The first step will have helped you become comfortable in balancing upside down. This posture will take you further by helping you develop basic stabilizer strength in your shoulders, wrists and fingers. Since this is not an inverse posture, always follow this exercise with wall headstands to combine the full effect of both strength-building and inverse balancing.

## Perfecting Your Technique
The key to this technique is appreciating the unique leverage point. The art to holding the balance in this exercise—as with more advanced hand-balancing exercises—lies in the use of sensitive finger strength to stop you from tipping forwards. If you start falling forwards, press hard with your fingers. Lift the legs nice and high to prevent yourself falling backwards.

Lean forwards, placing your knees securely on the outside of your elbows.

## Wall Handstand

Work up to: 2 minutes

## Performance
Approach a solid wall. Place your palms flat on the floor six to ten inches from the base of the wall, at about shoulder width apart. Your arms should be straight, or nearly so. Bend at the knees, bracing the whole body. Bring the knee of your strongest leg up towards the corresponding elbow (fig. 111) and push down hard with that leg, kicking back and up with the other leg. As you rise, allow the foot of your strongest leg to leave the floor and follow your other leg as it approaches the wall. Keep your arms extended. The heels of both your feet should touch the wall at the same time. At first your back and butt may also slam into the wall as you overestimate the power required to kick up, but over time you’ll learn the art of finding the wall perfectly. At this point your arms should be straight and your body aligned with a slight arch towards the wall. This is the position for the wall handstand technique. Hold this position for the required time, breathing normally.

## Exercise
Wall headstands will have taught you to get used to being upside-down. Crow stands will have given you the arm and wrist strength to safely balance your entire bodyweight through your hands. Once you have mastered these postures, the next thing you need to learn is the art of kicking up into a full handstand against the wall, which is somewhat more difficult than kicking up into a headstand due to the extension of the arms. Wall handstands will teach you this important skill. It also increases basic shoulder strength.

## Perfecting Your Technique
If you have been practicing the kick up into a wall headstand (Step 1), this technique shouldn’t be too difficult. You do have to kick harder, however. If this is too tricky at first, try kicking off something, like a box or a chair.

Place your palms flat on the floor six to ten inches from the base of the wall.

## Half Handstand Push Up

Work up to: 2 set of 20

## Performance
Approach a solid wall. Place your palms flat on the floor six to ten inches from the base of the wall, at about shoulder width apart. Keeping your arms as straight as possible, assume the position and kick up into a wall handstand (Step 3). You should now be in the classic wall handstand starting posture; your torso should be braced, your arms straight, and your body should curve backwards slightly to the point where your heels make a gentle contact with the wall. This is the start position for the half handstand pushup (fig. 113). Now bend at the shoulders and elbows until the top of your head is halfway towards touching the ground. This is the finish position (fig. 114). Pause briefly, before pushing firmly back up to the start position. The full range of motion for this technique will only be about six inches; at first, try not to overestimate and go too low. Breathe smoothly throughout the set.

Your shoulders, arms and torso will have gained some strength simply by holding the static posture of wall handstands (Step 3). This exercise is much more intense. It will add muscle and heft to the entire shoulder girdle, and help build powerful elbows and thick triceps. The upper pectorals also benefit.

Previous steps will have taught you how to kick up into a handstand against the wall without a problem. The movement required in half handstand pushups requires significant upper body strength, however. If the technique described above is too strenuous, simply reduce your range of motion. Begin by bending your arms and shoulders a short way—even if only a fraction of an inch. Build up your repetitions, and gradually add depth over time until your head reaches halfway towards the ground. You’ll get there, given time.

You should now be in the classic wall handstand starting posture.
Bend at the shoulders and elbows until the top of your head is halfway towards touching the ground.

## Handstand Push Up

Work up to: 2 sets of 15

## Performance
Approach a solid wall and place your palms flat on the ground approximately shoulder width apart and about six to ten inches from the wall. Bend at the knees and kick up against the wall into a handstand position. If you have worked through the steps so far you will now be pretty expert at this. If you have developed your own technique, that’s fine; calisthenics isn’t gymnastics—it’s the muscle-building portion of the exercise that’s of importance, not how you get there. Once you have found the wall, keep contact with it through your heels, maintaining a slight backwards arch in your body. Your arms should be straight. This is the start position (fig. 115). Bend at the shoulders and elbows until the top of your head gently makes contact with the floor. This is the finish position (fig. 116). Use kiss-the-baby pressure to protect your head (see pages 43—44). Pause briefly for a second, before pushing yourself back up to the start position. Apply muscular control and concentration in all inverse movements to ensure safety. Breathe as smoothly and evenly as possible.

## Exercise
This is the full Convict Conditioning handstand pushup, which develops and strengthens the shoulders, triceps, elbows, trapezius, pectorals and hands—in fact it has a power-building effect on the entire upper body. A lot of athletes feel the handstand pushup should be free—that is, clear of the wall. But this is a test of balance as much as strength. All the old school hand-balancers believed that if you want balance, you should build strength first.

The bottom position is the most difficult due to leverage. If you can’t do five full reps, don’t go all the way down at first. Add depth as you get stronger.

Once you have found the wall, keep contact with it through your heels.

## Closed Handstand Push Up

Work up to: 2 sets of 12

## Performance
Locate a solid wall and place your hands on the ground six to ten inches out from it. Your hands—specifically the index fingers—should be touching. Kick up into a handstand with straight arms and a lightly curved body tapering back to where the heels make contact with the wall. This is the start position (fig. 117). Keeping the elbows well out in front, bend at the shoulders and elbows until the head gently kisses the floor (fig. 118). Pause briefly—under full control—before pressing back up to the start position.

## Exercise
The full handstand pushup is an excellent basic exercise. It will teach you to use your strongest pressing muscles powerfully and with coordination. But if you want to move to very advanced unilateral handstand work you will need extremely powerful tendons, particularly around the elbows, forearms and wrists. Close handstand pushups develop that tendon strength. The close hand position makes it more difficult for the shoulder girdle to contribute to the movement, which in turn forces the elbows to become much stronger.

## Perfecting Your Technique
If you are strong enough you can usually jump from the progression standard of a step straight to the beginner standard of the next step without too many problems. In moving from handstand pushups to close handstand pushups however it’s best to take things slowly to allow the tendons to properly adapt to the full bodyweight. Once you have mastered the handstand pushup, gradually move your hands an inch closer every time you workout, or whenever you feel able to. Use floor markings if it helps. If your handstand pushup hand 

position is about eighteen inches apart, you should take eighteen weeks minimum to get to this step—more if you need it.

## Uneven Handstand Push Up

Work up to: 2 sets of 10

## Performance
Place a basketball by the base of a wall. Kick up into a wall handstand next to the basketball using whichever technique you find easiest, then reach out and place one of your palms on the basketball. This motion sounds simple but is in fact very difficult; it will require supporting your bodyweight on one locked arm for a fraction of a second, or as long as it takes to find the ball. Once your palm is secured on the basketball, position it so that your hands are about shoulder width apart. The arm of the hand which is on the floor should be straight, but your other arm will be bent. Apply your weight as evenly as you can through both hands, breathing smoothly. Your triceps, biceps and shoulders need to work very hard at this point, or you may lose control of the ball and crash down. This is the start position (fig. 119). Now bend at the elbows and shoulders until the head gently touches the floor. This is the finish position (fig. 120). Pause, and press back up.

## Exercise
In order to press yourself up, the basketball must be stabilized—it will tend to shoot outwards if not isometrically controlled. This will require huge arm and shoulder power, as well as Olympian rotator cuff muscles. The master of this exercise will earn shoulders like a gorilla and super-tough joints.

## Perfecting Your Technique
Using the ball requires a high degree of strength and balance, combined with quick reflexes. I would advise all athletes to begin this exercise using stable objects rather than a ball. Perhaps start with a flat brick and over build up to using three stacked flat, or a cinderblock. In the pen a lot of guys use slim books in a pile, adding a book whenever they can. When the pile is as high as a basketball, then experiment with a basketball. Always play it safe!

## Half One Arm Handstand Push Up

Work up to: 2 sets of 8

## Performance
Kick up into a handstand against a wall. Your body should be slightly arched, with your heels in contact with the wall. Your hands should be six to ten inches from the base of the wall, and shoulder width apart. Keep your arms straight. Now gradually press off with one palm, so that your center of gravity shifts towards the other side of the body. This will put more of your bodyweight through the opposite palm. Continue this transition over the course of a few seconds until there are only a few pounds of pressure left in the pushing palm. Now gently lift that palm away from the floor altogether, and hold it away from your body for balance. You will now be supporting yourself on one straight arm. This is the start position (fig. 121). Bend at the elbow and shoulder of your supporting arm until your head is halfway towards the floor. This is the finish position (fig. 122). Pause and press up.

## Exercise

This is the first technique in the series where you are pressing your entire bodyweight up with just one arm. This requires not only massive muscular strength in the shoulders and arms but extremely strong joints, total body coordination, excellent balance and an expert familiarity with inverse pressing techniques. To benefit from the half one-arm handstand pushup it’s essential that you have invested a lot of time milking the earlier exercises for all they are worth—for at least six months, maybe even longer. Don’t even attempt it otherwise, or you are only likely to injure yourself.

## Perfecting Your Technique
This is a hard exercise which can only be gradually mastered by increasing your range of motion over time. Trying to push the weight though the palm rather than the fingers will help align the pressing muscles properly.

You will now be supporting yourself on one straight arm.
Bend at the elbow and shoulder of your supporting arm until your head is halfway towards the floor.

## Lever Handstand Push Up

Work up to: 2 sets of 6

## Performance
Kick up into a handstand against a sturdy wall. As usual, your arms should be shoulder width apart and your fingers should be six to ten inches from the wall with only your feet touching the surface. This will leave a slight natural curve in your body. As with Step 8, slowly transfer the majority of your weight—approximately ninety percent—onto one palm. Now flip your other palm over, so that the back of hand is flat on the floor with the fingers pointing away from you. Straighten out your arm in front of you, maintaining contact with the floor as you go. Some pressure should still be flowing through the digits of this hand. This is the start position (fig. 123). Keeping the arm of the upturned hand extended, bend at the shoulder and elbow of your other arm, with full muscular control—don’t just allow your body to drop or you will hurt your head and possibly even crick your neck in the process. Pause as the top of your skull softly touches the floor. This is the finish position (fig. 124). Now, press back up to the start position, pushing through your palm and the back of your hand simultaneously.

## Exercise
This advanced exercise perfectly picks up where half one-arm handstand pushups leave off. The last step will have trained you to complete the top half of the motion, and lever handstand pushups help you master the more challenging bottom half. The position of the upturned hand makes it tough to apply much force with the assisting arm, ensuring you have just enough help to get you out of the bottom position with maximum muscular benefit.

## Perfecting Your Technique
Bending the assisting (i.e., palm up) arm and bringing it closer to the body will allow you to apply greater leverage. Extend the arm as you get stronger.

## One Arm Handstand Push Up

Work up to: 2 sets of 5

## Performance
Kick up into a handstand against a wall, and lean out to the side until you are supporting yourself with one arm, as in half one-arm handstand pushups (Step 8). Keep your body gently arched with the heels against the wall. This is the start position (fig. 125). Bend at the elbow and shoulder of your supporting arm until the top of your skull very gently touches the floor. Keep your non-supporting hand ready in case you make a mistake and it has to help out. This is the finish position (fig. 126). In pressing back up to the start position, some explosiveness may be needed. To help you get out of the bottom position, a kick up with the legs is permissible. Bend the knees with the feet still against the wall, and straighten them quickly to add some thrust.

## Exercise
The one-arm handstand pushup is the ultimate shoulder and arm exercise. Forget bench presses—all they cause is injury and grief. Work your way carefully through the handstand pushup series right up to this Master Step and you will be stronger—in terms of pure, functional, pick someone up and throw them power—than any bench presser you meet. In terms of weights, it’s the equivalent (for a two hundred pound man) of a one-arm two hundred pound press—that’s four hundred pounds on a bar! How many guys do you know who can even pick up four hundred pounds, let alone shoulder press it? And calisthenics will give you this power safely—with healthy shoulders.

## Perfecting Your Technique
You will have to work into this exercise by gradually increasing depth. In truth, the only way to really master this exercise is to spend years—maybe three years or more—working on it. But you were planning on getting three years older anyway, right? So why not be super-strong when you get there?
