## Vertical Pull Ups

Work up to: 3 sets of 40

### Performance
Find a vertical base you can hold on to. This base should be secure and allow you to grip it safely; a doorframe or high railings are excellent potential candidates. Stand close to the base—the tips of your toes should be between three and six inches out. Take hold of the object in a comfortable grip. Ideally your hands should be shoulder width but any symmetrical position will suffice. This is the start position (fig. 41). Because of your proximity to the base, your arms will be well bent. Now allow your bodyweight to shift back by leaning slightly. Extend your arms as you go, until they are very nearly straight, and your body is angled diagonally backwards. This is the finish position (fig. 42). At this point you will feel a gentle stretch in your upper back, and possibly your arms. Pause momentarily before pulling yourself back to the start position, by contracting the shoulder blades and bending the arms simultaneously. Pause and repeat.

### Exercise
Vertical pulls are a very gentle exercise. They are ideal for athletes rebuilding their back and arm strength, particularly following on from a shoulder, biceps or elbow injury. They increase blood flow and re-train the pulling “groove.” This is also an excellent exercise for any beginner. Its low intensity allows athletes new to pulling to really feel the muscles at work in the shoulders and upper back, before things get too heavy.

### Training Goals

| Beginner standard | 1 set | 10 |
| Intermediate standard | 2 sets | 20 |
| Progression standard | 3 sets | 40 |

### Perfecting Your Technique
This should be an easy exercise that virtually everybody should be able to do. If you are in rehabilitation from an injury and you find the motion too severe on an involved area (perhaps you have stitches), simply reduce the range of motion, tighten the shoulders, and don’t extend your arms as far.

Stand close to the base—the tips of your toes should be between three and six inches out.

At this point you will feel a gentle stretch in your upper back, and possibly your arms.

## Horizontal Pull Ups

Work up to: 3 sets of 30

### Performance
Find a horizontal base you can hold onto which will safely carry your bodyweight. It needs to be at least as high as your hips. The top of a big, sturdy, table or desk is usually the best option. Get down so that your chest and lower body are underneath the table and reach up so that you can hold the lip, using an overhand grip. Ideally your hands should be shoulder width but this will not always be possible depending upon what kind of table or desk you have access to. Now pull yourself up so that your back is off the floor. Depending upon the height of the table, your arms will probably have to be slightly bent for this. Keep your body tensed and locked straight, so that its weight goes only thorough your hands and heels. This is the start position (fig. 43). Now smoothly pull yourself up, keeping the body (especially the knees) aligned, until your chest touches the lip of the table at the point where your hands are gripping. This is the finish position (fig. 44). Pause for a count of one, before lowering back to the start position. Repeat.

### Exercise
Horizontal pulls are similar in theme to vertical pulls, but they place the body at a much more severe angle. As a result, the strength is tested more intensely. This is an excellent intermediate exercise to master before the athlete begins the hanging work on the horizontal bar which follows. This movement conditions the joints, significantly the vulnerable elbows and shoulders.

### Training Goals

| Beginner standard | 1 set | 10 |
| Intermediate standard | 2 sets | 20 |
| Progression standard | 3 sets | 30 |

---

### Perfecting Your Technique
The higher the object you are pulling up to, the less extreme the angle of the body, and the easier the exercise. If horizontal pulls are just too hard for you at first, try to find something higher than hip height to pull yourself up to. Once you can do thirty reps, try pulling from the hip height base again.

## Jackknife Pull Ups

Work up to: 3 sets of 20

### Performance
To perform this preliminary pullup exercise, you will require a high horizontal bar and a high-backed chair or similar object situated just in front of the bar. Jump up and grab hold of the bar. Your arms should be approximately shoulder width apart, in an overhand grip. When working with the bar, always keep your shoulders good and “tight” (see page 117). Don’t fully relax your arms, either; keep them flexed and with a slight kink in the elbows. Now swing your legs up and rest your calves near the ankles on the back of the object you’ve placed in front of the bar. Arrange this object beforehand so that you’ll be able to straighten your legs out. Ideally, the object should be high enough that the feet of your straight legs end up opposite your pelvis—the classic jackknife angle. This is the start position (fig. 45). Now smoothly pull yourself up, using your straightened legs to assist you by pushing down with them. When your chin passes the bar, you are in the finish position (fig. 46). Pause before lowering yourself to the start position under full muscular control. Take care getting down when you’ve  finished your set, and don’t work to failure.” If your grip releases before your feet are directly below you, you risk falling and hurting yourself.

### Exercise
Jackknife pullups train the athlete in the basic full-range pullup motion, although this exercise is easier than full pullups because the legs take some of the weight and can provide assistance in the bottom position.

### Training Goals

| Beginner standard | 1 set | 10 |
| Intermediate standard | 2 sets | 15 |
| Progression standard | 3 sets | 20 |

---

### Perfecting Your Technique
The bottom position is the hardest portion of any pullup exercise. If you can’t do full-range jackknife pullups, focus on the top position with the arms bent, and gradually add depth to your movement as you gain strength.

## Half Pull Ups

Work up to: 2 sets of 15

### Performance
Take hold of a horizontal bar. The bar should be high enough that your feet are clear of the floor—even if only by an inch—when your body hangs down straight. Use an overhand grip which is shoulder width or a little wider. Jump up so that you are supporting your weight on arms that are bent approximately at right angles (your upper arms should be parallel to the floor). Keep your shoulders tight. Bend at the knees, looping one ankle over the other to take the legs out of the movement. This is the start position (fig. 47). Smoothly pull yourself up by bending at the shoulders and elbows until your chin clears the height of the bar. This is the finish position (fig. 48). Allow your elbows to travel forwards if it seems “right” for you. Pause at the top for a moment, before lowering to the start position under control. Repeat as needed. After you get set, keep the legs still throughout the entire motion.

### Exercise X-Ray
Things are getting serious now. During half pullups, the upper body muscles exclusively move the entire weight of the body—certainly more than the average man can comfortably row or use on pulldowns. As a result the grip is strengthened and the back, biceps and forearms are developed.

### Training Goals

| Beginner standard | 1 set | 8 |
| Intermediate standard | 2 sets | 11 |
| Progression standard | 2 sets | 15 |

---

### Perfecting Your Technique
This is the first movement in the pullup series where the athlete is expected to move his full bodyweight through space without assistance. Consequently, it proves a sticking point for many trainees, particularly heavier or overweight guys. It’s at this point when you need to start losing excess fat, if you have any—and most people do. You can still work on this exercise as you drop weight. If you find it difficult just reduce the range of motion, staying nearer the bar. As your weight decreases, your range of motion will increase.

## Full Pull Ups

Work up to: 2 sets of 10

### Performance
Grab hold of a horizontal bar with a shoulder width overhand grip. A slightly wider grip is acceptable—experiment to find out which width feels strongest for you. Bend at the knee and loop the ankles behind your body. Your feet should be clear of the ground. Tense the body, keep the shoulders down tight and retain a very slight (almost unnoticeable) bend in the elbows to take the stress off the arm joints and place it on the muscles instead. This is the start position (fig. 49). Bend at the elbows and shoulders until your chin passes over the bar. This is the finish position (fig. 50). Enjoy the view! Pause for a moment, before reversing the motion under full control. Don’t be explosive—this means depending on momentum during the exercise. The perfect muscle-building technique is smooth. Try to take two seconds up and two seconds down, pausing for a second at the top and bottom.

### Exercise X-Ray
The full pullup is the classic muscle and power exercise for the upper back and biceps. The master of this exercise will possess superior functional mobility and athletic strength. The human body evolved to pull itself up well—a man who cannot do pullups cannot be considered to be truly strong.

### Perfecting Your Technique
Full pullups are a heavy calisthenics exercise. If you find them difficult, you are not alone. The key is perseverance. Resist the early urge to “kip” the body up (see page 118)—this will only ingrain the habit. Instead, help yourself out of the difficult bottom (extended arms) position by placing one foot on a chair and gently pressing down. Use less foot pressure every time you train, until eventually you are only using your foot through the first three or four inches. Eventually you’ll be able to do full pullups unassisted.

## Closed Pull Ups

Work up to: 2 sets of 10

### Performance 
“Jump up and grab a bar with an overhand grip. Your hands should be next to each other—four inches apart at the maximum, if a very close grip irritates your joints. Bend at the knees with your ankles looped behind your vertical plane to keep them out of the motion. Kink the elbows very slightly and keep your shoulders tight. This is the start position (fig. 51). Bend at the elbows and shoulders to raise your body, slowly levering yourself up until your chin passes the bar. This is the finish position (fig. 52). Pause for a count of one, before slowly lowering yourself back down to the start position. Pause and repeat. Try to minimize leg movement during the set.

### Exercise
The weakest link in all pullup movements are the arm flexors—the biceps and related upper arm/forearm muscles. If an athlete has mastered two-arm pullups and wishes to progress to the single arm version, he will have to spend time radically strengthening his biceps. This is what close pullups do—bringing the hands nearer together puts the bigger, stronger back muscles at a disadvantage and forces more of the load on the arm flexors. Close pullups will force your biceps to grow larger and more powerful.

### Perfecting Your Technique
Some athletes trained in the full pullup find this exercise difficult, because during close pullups the arms try to pronate (turn inwards) as you pull. Sometimes an overhand grip limits this natural twisting motion. This is a good time to experiment with your grip; try a side on, or underhand grip. Experiment with ring work if you can (see page 118). See what works for you. If strength is a problem, continue with full pullups, bringing your arms an inch closer every workout or so. Over time, you’ll master the close grip.

## Uneven Pull Ups

Work up to: 2 sets of 9

### Performance
Grasp the horizontal bar with one hand. A side-on or underhand grip will be more comfortable than the classic overhand version. Now take hold of the wrist of the hand which is gripping the bar, using your free hand. The thumb of the hand holding your wrist should be just below your opposite palm, with the fingers below the back of your hand. Your feet should be off the ground, knees bent, with your ankles looped behind you. Your shoulder girdle should be flexed at all times. The arm that is holding the bar should be straight except for a slight kink in the elbow. Your other arm, due to its lower position, will be bent more acutely. Your elbows will be in front of your torso. This is the start position (fig. 53). Bend at the elbows and shoulders to smoothly pull yourself up until your chin is over the bar. This is the finish position (fig. 54). Pause at the top, before slowly lowering yourself back down to the start position. Pause again before repeating.

### “Exercise X-Ray
Uneven pullups go back centuries, but they were made instantly popular again when Sylvester Stallone performed them during the famous training montage of Rocky II. Due to the altered arm position, the arm gripping the bar has to do the majority of the work, preparing the athlete for the true unilateral pullup movements which follow in the series. The lats, biceps and back gain in strength as a result. The grip in particular gets a great workout.

| Intermediate standard | 2 sets | 7 |

### Perfecting Your Technique
If you are strong enough to do close pullups, you should be able to do uneven pullups. The biggest difference is the fact that you have to hold your bodyweight with just one hand in this step. If you find this tough, devote some time to hanging one-handed after your pullups, to improve your grip.

## Half One Arm Pull Ups

Work up to: 2 sets of 8

### Performance
Grab an overhead bar with one hand, using your strongest gripping position. For some people, this will be an overhand grip; for others, side-on or underhand. Using a hanging ring is probably ideal for most people. Place your other arm anywhere that seems comfortable; most of my students like to leave it out to the side in mid-air, but I personally prefer placing it in the small of my back, as for one-arm pushups. Any position that doesn’t interfere is fine. Set yourself (by jumping, kipping, using a chair, etc.) so that your lifting arm is bent halfway. The elbow should be at a right angle, with your upper arm parallel to the ground. Your feet should be clear of the floor and looped behind you as for previous steps. The shoulder of your lifting arm should be tightly braced, and your whole body flexed. This is the start position (fig. 55). Bend at the elbow and shoulder and smoothly pull your body up until your chin is over the height of the bar. This is the finish position (fig. 56). Pause at the top, before slowly lowering yourself back down to the start position. Pause at the bottom and repeat.”

### Exercise X-Ray
This is the first step in the series where the student pulls his total bodyweight with one hand. As well as teaching the balance and technical groove required for full one-arm pullups, it develops huge biceps and back power and builds big arms. It doesn’t train the muscles in the stretched position though, so add a full-range motion such as uneven pullups or close pullups afterwards.

### Perfecting Your Technique
The lower you descend, the harder pullups are. If you can’t quite manage half one-arm pullups yet, focus on the top range of the motion, nearest the bar. Over time, add depth inch by inch until you can do this step properly.

## Assisted One Arm Pull Ups

Work up to: 2 sets of 7

### “Performance
Throw a towel over a horizontal bar. Jump up and grasp the bar with your strongest grip so that the hanging towel is towards the inside of your hand. With your opposite hand, grab the towel as low as possible—around eye level is about right for most athletes. Bend the knees with the ankles looped behind the body. Keep the shoulders braced, and retain a slight bend in the arm which is holding the bar. This is the start position (fig. 57). Now begin to pull yourself up. For the first half of the movement—until the elbow of the arm holding the bar is bent at a right angle—assist yourself by pulling on the towel. Halfway up—when the elbow of the arm holding the bar is bent at a right-angle—release the towel, and continue pulling yourself up with just one arm until your chin is over the bar (fig. 58). Pause, before lowering yourself down using the power of your lone arm. When you reach the lowest position, grip the towel once again. Pause and repeat.”

Excerpt From: Paul Wade. “Convict Conditioning.” Apple Books. 

### Exercise X-Ray
Assisted pullups are a specialized exercise. Their specific function is to help an advanced student “feel out” one-arm pullups, without getting stuck in the lowest position. This exercise slowly and safely builds the enormous levels of tendon strength required to correctly execute true one-arm pullups.

| Intermediate standard | 2 sets | 25 |

### Perfecting Your Technique
“The further your hand is down the towel or rope you use, the harder it is to provide assistance. If you have trouble getting five reps on this exercise, hold the towel nearer up to the bar. As you get stronger, hold the towel lower down. Eventually you will feel you are pushing down on the towel, rather than pulling. This is a great way to advance on assisted one-arm pullups and eventually prepare yourself for the Master Step—one-arm pullups.

FIG. 57: With your opposite hand, grab the towel as low as possible—around eye level is about right for most athletes.

FIG. 58: Release the towel, and continue pulling yourself up with just one arm until your chin is over the bar.

## One Arm Pull Ups

Work up to: 2 sets of 6

### Performance
Jump up and firmly squeeze an overhead bar using your strongest gripping position. Your legs should be clear of the floor, with your knees bent so that your feet are behind you. Loop one ankle over the other to keep your legs still. Place your non-lifting arm in a comfortable position (you should have found your ideal position when you learned Step 8, half one-arm pullups). Your working shoulder should be set tight, and your body tensed for action. You are about to perform an advanced strength feat, and this should be reflected in your psychology. Your working arm should be virtually straight, with just a little kink in it to take the stress of the joints. This is the start position (fig. 59). Bend at the elbow and shoulder and pull your body up with as little momentum as possible until your chin is over the height of the bar. This is the finish position (fig. 60). Pause, and smoothly lower yourself back down to the start position. Pause at the bottom and repeat—if you can!

### Exercise X-Ray
One-arm pullups, performed deeply and without “kipping” are the greatest back and arm exercise possible. They confer mighty strength and size. The master of this exercise will earn lats that look like wings and his upper back will be sprouting muscles like coiled pythons. Plus, he’ll own a grip, arms and forearms vastly more powerful than the average gym rat—in fact he could probably rip a bodybuilder’s arm off in an arm wrestling match.

### Perfecting Your Technique
This is one hell of a hard technique, and although you can master it with dedication and effort, don’t expect to do it overnight! Really take your time to milk the preliminary nine steps first. Initially, aim for just a single good rep, and practice consolidation training when you manage it
