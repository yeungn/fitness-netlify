### Dips
Dips are usually considered to be an exercise for the pushing muscles, and it’s true that they work the pecs and triceps hard. But because the arms strongly move downwards during the movement, the lats become significantly involved as well. In fact, I’ve met guys who get sorer lats from dips than from pullups. Grab some parallel bars—or position yourself between two chairs—and support your weight on straight arms. Bend at the shoulders and elbows until your elbows are at right angles, and pause for a moment before smoothly pushing back up. Bench dips (dips with the feet up on a stable surface) also work the lats, but to a lesser degree because the total bodyweight isn’t moved.

### Sentry Pull Ups
I’m a big believer that every student of bodyweight training should have at least one explosive movement in their arsenal for each bodypart. Sentry pull-ups are one of the best. Jump up to a chinning bar and do a full pullup. But don’t stop at the top—keep lifting your torso up until it is over the bar, and then press your arms to lockout so that you are fully extended, with the bar at hip level. This should be performed as one fluid movement, and it will require some momentum to achieve. The explosive pullup works the back and biceps, and the circular transitional movement into a downwards press position very powerfully trains the elbows, wrists and forearms. The final part of the technique, the downwards press, works the same muscles as dips; triceps, pectorals and lats, mainly. Drop back down and repeat the exercise once your arms are straight. In the early days, you’ll find yourself jumping hard to achieve the transition, but you’ll do this less and less as you get stronger. In some circles, this exercise is called the muscle-up. In San Quentin, where I first learned this technique, the convicts called them "sentry pullups,” although I’ve never heard the name anywhere else. I don’t know for sure, but if I had to guess, I’d say that they were called this because it looks like the guy doing them is pulling himself up on something, to spy out into the distance. If I’m wrong and someone else knows the real source of the name, please write in and tell me."

### Elbow Press
This is an interesting, effective and little known exercise. Lie on your back on the floor, with your elbows down either side of you, a few inches out from your torso. Your forearms should be perpendicular to the ground, and your body must be locked straight, legs together. Now, if you push back hard through your elbows, you will—if you are strong enough—find that you can lift your body off the ground, holding your weight up only through your heels and elbows. At first, you will be barely able to clear the floor, but over time you’ll be able to push your torso up to six inches off the ground. Your body must be held stiff, and only your elbows and heels should touch the floor as you rise. I’ve found that balling the hands into fists helps this movement for some reason. Lower yourself back down gently, and repeat for reps. Placing a couple of towels under the elbows will make the movement more comfortable. This exercise powerfully works the lats and mid-back, and the spine gets an isometric workout. It is essentially a rowing movement, but without the use of an external weight. Because nothing is held in the hands, only the back muscles move the load—the biceps and forearms are not involved. As a result, this is a brilliant exercise to use to keep your back muscles strong if you have injured an arm.

### Bar Pulls
Convicts have been pulling on the bars of their cells to build strength for hundreds of years. If you are creative, you can use solid bars to give yourself a full body isometric workout. You might be surprised at what a versatile discipline bar pulling can be; I have a list of over a hundred bar pulling techniques in an old notebook somewhere. Bar pulls are an excellent method for training the back, so I’ll limit myself here to a description of just one bar pulling workout for the back, consisting of a handfull of the best techniques:

### Hulk Pulls
Grab hold of two bars in front of your chest. Your forearms should be more or less parallel with the floor and your knuckles should be about six inches apart—the equivalent of one bar space. Your arms will be well bent so that your torso is only a few inches from the bars. This is the strongest bar pull position. Now pull as hard as you can, as if trying to pry the bars apart. This beauty works the arms and shoulders but especially the back muscles between the shoulder blades. When you get used to the position, you can generate a great deal of power in this pull. When you see the bars bending a little, you know you’re heading in the right direction! Apply as much force as you can, breathing normally, for a count of five seconds. Take a ten second break, and repeat five more times.

### Bow Pulls
Grab hold of a single vertical bar with both hands. One hand should be approximately face level, the other chest level. Your arms should be nearly straight, but with a little bend at the elbow. As a result, your torso will be about two-thirds arm length from the bars. Now, push as hard as you can with the higher arm, whilst simultaneously pulling with the lower arm. The sensation is a little like the beginning motion of pulling back on a bow as in archery. Hold this push-pull tension for five seconds, before quickly reversing the dynamic; pull with your higher hand, push with your lower. Hold for five more seconds. Then take a ten second break before switching arms, so your lower arm is up highest, and the higher one is down lower. Repeat the above procedure. All this constitutes one cycle. Follow this process for another four cycles. The torque generated by the push-pull motion works the entire torso, and the varied arm position hits the lats nicely.

### Crucifix Pulls
Provided you have been working as hard as you can, by now your back will be sizzling. Time to deliver the final bullet to those aching muscles. Spread eagle your arms and grasp hold of the furthest bars you can comfortably grip. Press your chest up against the bars. Now—without moving at the elbows—pull directly backwards at the bars with all your might. In this position, the body won’t be able to generate much force, but try hard anyway. If you’re doing this right, you’ll feel the small muscles of the back nearest your arms standing out, and cramping and burning. These muscles are the rear deltoids, and they are vitally important to strength in back training, as well as playing a major role overall shoulder stability. Hold this painful pull, squeezing the back muscles as hard as you can, for ten seconds. Pause for five seconds, before repeating. Do this exercise five times. Crucifix pulls are a brilliant finisher; although they will leave you sweating and in pain, they require no kit, and four cycles will take under a minute.
