## Knee Tucks

Work up to: 3 sets of 40

### Performance
Sit on the edge of a chair or bed. Lean back a little, grip the edge of the seat with your hands, and straighten your legs. Your feet should be together with the heels raised a few inches from the floor. This is the start position (fig. 61). Smoothly bring the knees up and in until they are approximately six to ten inches from your chest. Exhale as you draw the knees in. By the time the motion is complete, you should have exhaled fully and your abs should be tightly contracted. This is the finish position (fig. 62). Pause for a count of one before reversing the motion and finishing again in the start position. Inhale as you extend. Your feet should follow a straight line backwards and forwards, and should not touch the floor until the set is completed. Keep the stomach tucked in at all times. Resist the urge to pump out reps quickly. As with all waist techniques, take extra breaths between reps if you need to.

### Exercise
Knee tucks are an ideal midsection exercise for beginners. They cultivate good spinal posture, condition the abdominal muscles and strengthen the hip flexors. They are also relatively easy for most people and for this reason they present a great opportunity to start developing perfect technique for all your midsection exercises. Important elements to remember include smooth motion, correct breathing rhythm and keeping the stomach held in tightly.

### Perfecting Your Technique
This exercise is equally hard in the start position—where the legs are stretched out—and in the finish position—where the knees are pulled towards the chest. To make the exercise a little easier, focus on a shorter range of motion between these two extremes. As your waist becomes stronger, gradually lengthen the range of motion until your form is perfect.

## Flat Knee Raises

Work up to: 3 sets of 35

### Performance
Lie flat on the floor, with your legs together and your arms by your side. Bend your knees so that they are at approximately ninety degrees (i.e., a right angle), with the feet an inch or two off the ground. Pressing hard on the floor with your hands will help keep your torso stable. This is the start position (fig. 63). Now smoothly bring your knees up over your hips, so that your thighs are perpendicular to the floor, and your calves are parallel to the floor. Keep the knees at a right angle throughout and exhale as you go, keeping your stomach muscles tight. This is the finish position (fig. 64). Pause for a count of one, before reversing the motion by extending your legs as you lower your feet. Inhale as you return to the start position. After you begin, at no point throughout the movement should your feet touch the floor.

### Exercise
This exercise continues where knee tucks leaves off, further strengthening the waist. Flat knee raises train the spinal muscles, abdominal muscles, obliques and transversus to function in a coordinated way. The muscles of the frontal thigh are also toned. The position on the floor requires increased hip flexor involvement, which will condition the athlete for the more intense floor and hanging exercises which come later in the leg raise series.

### Perfecting Your Technique
One of the hardest elements of this exercise is keeping the feet off the floor with the legs outstretched. If this is causing you trouble, return your feet to the floor between repetitions. When you gain the strength to do reps while continuously keeping your feet off the floor, do so—even if it’s only two repetitions—then as you tire complete the set by resting your feet on the floor between reps. Over time keep gradually adding reps with your feet clear of the floor.

Bend your knees so that they are at approximately ninety degrees.

Keep the knees at a right angle throughout and exhale as you go.

## Flat Bent Knee Raises

Work up to: 3 sets of 30

### Performance
Lie on your back with your legs together and stretched out on the floor. Your hands should be by your sides, and also in contact with the floor. Raise your legs, bending them at the knee approximately forty-five degrees from the straight alignment. Your feet should be kept an inch or two off the floor. This is the start position (fig. 65). The positive portion of the exercise involves raising the legs and feet smoothly—over a count of two seconds—until the feet are directly above the pelvis (fig. 66). As you move, the angle of the knee should not change; it must remain locked in the same position. Pressing down on the floor with the hands will help you stabilize your torso throughout the movement. Pause at the top, before reversing the motion. Pause again in the start position before repeating as necessary. Exhale as the feet move up, inhale as they are moving down. Keep the stomach tight at all times. The feet should not touch the floor at all during the set.

### Exercise
The flat bent leg raise is a very simple continuation of the flat knee raise. Extending the knees places the feet farther away from the body, making the exercise harder due to leverage. This increases the stress on the hips and all the muscles of the waist and abdomen, building more strength and tone.

### Perfecting Your Technique
Flat knee raises involve a ninety degree knee bend. Flat bent leg raises require a forty-five degree knee bend. The less the degree of bend, the greater the amount of leverage and the harder the exercise becomes. If you cannot meet the beginner standard, use more of a knee bend—a little less than ninety degrees. As you get stronger, start straightening your legs little by little, until you meet the forty-five degree criterion.

As you move, the angle of the knee should not change; it must remain locked in the same position.

## Flat Frog Raises

Work up to: 3 sets of 25

### Performance
Perform the positive portion of Step 3, the bent leg raise, but instead of pausing at the top (fig. 66), straighten your legs out fully. They should be perfectly straight, and perpendicular to the floor, so that your legs and torso form a right angle. This is the finish position (fig. 67). You should exhale throughout this two-part motion. In most midsection work you would now reverse the movement; but not so here. Your muscles are stronger when lowering under resistance (because gravity helps), and frog raise techniques take advantage of this fact. Lower your legs, keeping them perfectly straight (fig. 68) until they are an inch or two off the floor (fig. 69). In most exercises you should take about two seconds to go up and two seconds to go down. But for this exercise count four seconds down, to allow your body more work in the stronger position. Inhale as your legs slowly descend. Repeat.

### Exercise
Whether they are performed in a flat or hanging position, the jump from bent knee raises to straight leg raises is a pretty big 
one because of the increase in flexible strength required. Frog raise techniques help athlete make this jump. They act as an ideal intermediary between bent knee raise and straight leg raise movements because they develop both strength and flexibility in the areas required, the hamstrings and back. Unfortunately frog raise movements are not very well known to the training public. They seemed to get lost after the sixties when leg raises became less popular and crunches took over.

### Perfecting Your Technique
If you find this exercise difficult, focus your workouts on the top range—around the frog extension technique where the legs are up in the air. As you become stronger over time, slowly add depth until you are doing full reps.

## Flat Straight Leg Raises

Work up to: 2 sets of 20

### Performance
Lie on the floor, face up. Your feet should be together, your legs should be straight, and your arms should be by your sides. Lift your feet an inch or two from the floor. Pressing down with the hands will help you keep your torso stable. This is the start position (fig. 70). Now, keeping your legs locked, raise your feet until they are directly above your pelvis. Exhale as you lift, keeping the stomach tight. It should take you at least two seconds to smoothly accomplish this—don’t explode up. Your legs and torso will form a right angle at this point. This is the finish position (fig. 71). Pause briefly, before reversing the motion exactly, inhaling as you go down. Pause again in the start position and repeat. At no point should allow your knees to unlock, and your heels shouldn’t touch the floor until the set is completed.

### Exercise
This exercise is a favorite in military training camps and martial arts schools alike, because it increases stomach and hip power and stamina, while promoting function and flexibility at the same time. It is deceptively easy, however; just bending the knees a fraction and bouncing the feet off the floor makes the exercise much easier. Unfortunately it also makes the exercise far less productive in terms of pure strength and conditioning.

### Perfecting Your Technique
Perfecting Your Technique
This exercise can be made a lot easier by bending the knees; but that’s not an advisable shortcut because the major benefits of this exercise come from the fact that the legs are straight. If you can’t meet the beginner standard, go back to flat frog raises (Step 4) and build up to 3 sets of 30 reps before trying again. If you still have problems, keep the legs straight but focus on shorter, top range reps and acquire more depth whenever you are able to.
Pressing down with the hands will help you keep your torso stable.

## Hanging Knee Raises

Work up to: 2 sets of 15

### Performance
Jump up and grab an overhead bar. Your hands should be about shoulder width apart. The bar needs to be high enough that your feet hang clear from the ground, even if only by an inch. Your body should be in a straight line, and you must keep your shoulders tight (see page 117). This is the start position (fig. 72). Bring your knees up smoothly until they are level with your pelvis and your knees are at a right angle. Your thighs will be parallel with the floor. Exhale during this motion, keeping your stomach pulled in. This is the finish position (fig. 73). Pause for a moment, then reverse the motion until your body is fully extended, inhaling as you go. Repeat.

### Exercise
Exercise X-Ray
With this step, the athlete begins the harder hanging movements of the midsection series. While on the floor, the athlete was only partially fighting the forces of gravity; now he has to overcome gravity fully. The increased intensity amplifies hip and midsection strength radically, in a short space of time. In addition the bar hang element increases the activity of the important ribcage muscles (the serratus and intercostals) which function as intermediaries between the arms and abdomen. For this reason hanging ab work is vastly superior to ab work on parallel bars or similar devices.

### Perfecting Your Technique
If you can’t handle at least five good, strict reps of this exercise, reduce your range of motion. Focus on the top portion where the knees are in the finish position, and gradually add depth over time. Whatever you do, resist the urge to use momentum. Using smooth, controlled motions early on in the series will build a base of muscle and tendon strength which will prove invaluable if you wish to master later steps. Momentum won’t help.

## Hanging Bent Leg Raises

Work up to: 2 sets of 15

### Performance
Grab an overhead bar so that your body is in a straight line and your feet are clear of the ground. Your hands should be approximately shoulder width, and your shoulders kept nice and tight. Now bend at the knees until your knee joints are angled off straight by around forty-five degrees. This will put your feet a few inches behind the rest of your hanging body. This is the start position (fig. 74). Smoothly raise your legs at the hips until your feet are opposite your pelvis. This is the finish position (fig. 75). Pause and reverse the motion, before repeating. Only move at the hips; keep your knee angle locked into place. Exhale as you raise your legs, inhale as you lower them. Keep the abs tense.

### Exercise
Hanging bent leg raises are a harder extension of hanging knee raises. In hanging knee raises, the knees are bent at ninety degrees, in hanging bent leg raises they are at forty-five. The increased leverage this provides makes the exercise the hardest in the series yet, and it develops the midsection accordingly. The abdomen, waist, serratus and hip flexors all get stronger.

### Perfecting Your Technique
At first, you may find it difficult to keep your knees locked at the correct angle throughout the motion. There will be a tendency to straighten the legs out a little as you lower them. Try to avoid this, because resetting the correct angle as the legs are raised tends to impart momentum which leads to a swinging motion. If you have trouble with the exercise from the start, simply increase the angle of the knee bend from forty-five degrees to closer to ninety degrees. As you gain strength from workout to workout, gradually extend the legs until you meet your goal of forty-five degrees.

## Hanging Frog Raises

Work up to: 2 sets of 15

### Performance
Assume a start position identical to Step 7, hanging bent leg raises (fig. 74), and raise your legs just as you would for that same exercise. Once you reach the top position with your feet in line with your hips (fig. 75), extend your feet out in a line directly away from you, so that your legs are perfectly straight. This will put your locked legs level with the floor, and your upper and lower body at a right angle (fig. 76). Pause for a moment, but do not reverse the motion. Instead, lower your legs while keeping them locked out perfectly straight (fig. 77). Finish with your body fully extended (fig. 78) before assuming the start position again and repeating for the desired number of reps. Exhale as the legs are going up, inhale as they are going down, and keep the stomach tucked in at all times.”

### Exercise
Hanging frog raises emphasize the fact that the finish position and negative (downwards) phase of leg raises are easier in terms of mechanics and leverage than the start position and positive (upwards) phase. By working hard with this exercise you can increase your strength and flexibility faster than would normally be possible, allowing you to more easily make the transition to straight leg variants of the leg raise (Steps 9 and 10).”

### Perfecting Your Technique
If you can meet the progression standard for hanging bent leg raises, five reps of hanging frog raises should be well within your capabilities. When students have difficulty moving from bent leg raises to frog-type movements, the issue is usually lack of flexibility rather than strength. This can be easily cured by bending forwards and stretching out the lower back and hamstrings for a few minutes before attempting this exercise.”
Extend your feet out in a line directly away from you.

## Hanging Partial Straight Leg Raises

Work up to: 2 sets of 15

### Performance
Hang from an overhead bar, with your body in a straight line and your feet off the floor. Tighten the shoulders. Lift the locked legs until they are at a forty-five degree angle, and hold. This is the start position (fig. 79). Keeping your knees locked straight, smoothly raise your legs until they are parallel with the floor. This is the finish position (fig. 80). Pause for a moment, before lowering the legs back to a forty-five degree angle. Repeat. Exhale as your legs move up, inhale as they move down. Keep the abs tight.”

### Exercise
Straight leg raises, performed with locked knees and without momentum are an incredibly hard exercise—only perhaps one in five hundred serious trainees (maybe less) can execute them. One of the things that makes them so hard is the full range of motion—from the body straight all the way up to the jackknife right angle position. Once the athlete has developed the strength and flexibility required to perform the legs extended top position (as a result of hanging frog raises), hanging partial straight leg raises capitalize on this, by making the top position a little harder, and eliminating the rest.

### Perfecting Your Technique
If you have met the progression standard for hanging frog raises, this means you will be able to hold the advanced legs extended position of the leg raise (fig. 80). If you find that partial straight leg raises are too hard, it must be because the range of motion is still too great for your strength levels. Focus on doing this exercise near the legs extended finish position, moving your legs down and back up, even if you can only move a few inches at first. Over time, your strength will increase and you’ll be able to move your legs down to the full forty-five degree position and back up again.

## Hanging Straight Leg Raises

Work up to: 2 sets of 15

### Performance
You know the drill by now! Take hold of an overhead bar which is high enough to leave your feet a short distance from the floor when your body is extended. Your hands should be approximately shoulder width apart. Ensure that the shoulders are tight. This is the start position (fig. 81). Smoothly—over the course of at least two seconds—raise your legs until they are parallel with the floor. Exhale as your legs rise, blowing all the air you can out of your lungs so that the abdomen is fully contracted. This is the finish position (fig. 82). Pause, before reversing the motion perfectly for at least another two seconds until you are back in the start position. Inhale as you go. Remain flexed,” even in the start position. Your legs must stay locked at all times and you must use pure muscular control; no momentum allowed.”

### Exercise
Hanging straight leg raises—performed strictly, according to the protocols given above—are the greatest all-round midsection exercise in existence. They blow crunches, machine work, and weighted sit-ups out of the water. By the time you can execute even twenty perfect reps of this exercise, your waist will be powerful and flexible, your obliques, serratus, transversus and intercostals will be carved out of solid rock and your abdominal muscles will be like plate steel. You will have a six-pack from hell!

When you begin hanging straight leg raises, you should have already mastered hanging partial straight leg raises. If you haven’t, go back and do so. If you have mastered the partial version, all you need to do is slowly increase your depth of motion from workout to workout—even by a fraction of an inch—and you’ll be able to pull off this exercise before you know it.
