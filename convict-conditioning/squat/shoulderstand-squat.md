“Lie on your back, with your knees well bent. Kick against the floor while pushing with your hands until your feet are up in the air. As you reach this position, place your hands on your lower back for support, whilst keeping your upper arms firmly on the floor. You will now be in a shoulderstand position, supported by your shoulders and upper back, as well as the backs of your upper arms. Remember to constantly support your weight through these areas and keep any pressure off the neck. Your body should be locked straight, not bent at the hips. This is the start position (fig. 21). Keeping your torso as upright as possible, bend at the hips and knees until your knees touch your forehead. This is the finish position (fig. 22). Extend your legs directly back up, until your body is back in the start position. Repeat.

Exercise X-Ray
Shoulderstand squats are the perfect preliminary exercise for anybody who wants to start squatting. Due to the inverse position of the body, there is virtually no weight going through the ”“knees and lower back. This makes them an ideal rehabilitation exercise to help those with back or knee injuries—perhaps coming out of surgery—to get back into sports where leg motion is crucial. In strength terms, shoulderstand squats are in fact harder on the upper body than the lower body. But they do free up tight joints, increase range of motion and set beginners on the road to perfect form.”
