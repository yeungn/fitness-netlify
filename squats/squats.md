## Shoulderstand Squats

work up to 3 sets of 50 then begin the next

### Performance
Lie on your back, with your knees well bent. Kick against the floor while pushing with your hands until your feet are up in the air. As you reach this position, place your hands on your lower back for support, whilst keeping your upper arms firmly on the floor. You will now be in a shoulderstand position, supported by your shoulders and upper back, as well as the backs of your upper arms. Remember to constantly support your weight through these areas and keep any pressure off the neck. Your body should be locked straight, not bent at the hips. This is the start position. Keeping your torso as upright as possible, bend at the hips and knees until your knees touch your forehead. This is the finish position. Extend your legs directly back up, until your body is back in the start position. Repeat.

### Exercise
Shoulderstand squats are the perfect preliminary exercise for anybody who wants to start squatting. Due to the inverse position of the body, there is virtually no weight going through the knees and lower back. This makes them an ideal rehabilitation exercise to help those with back or knee injuries—perhaps coming out of surgery—to get back into sports where leg motion is crucial. In strength terms, shoulderstand squats are in fact harder on the upper body than the lower body. But they do free up tight joints, increase range of motion and set beginners on the road to perfect form.

### Training Goals

| Beginner standard | 1 set | 10 |
| Intermediate standard | 2 sets | 25 |
| Progression standard | 3 sets | 50 |

---

### Perfecting Your Technique
At the first attempt, not everybody will be able to touch the knees to the forehead. Try to increase the depth of your knees every workout and your joints will soon loosen. The technique will be virtually impossible for people with very fat stomachs, because the paunch gets in the way. Practicing on an empty stomach will help, until you shed those excess pounds.

## Jackknife Squats

work up to 3 sets of 40 then begin the next

### Performance
Stand in front of a sturdy object which comes up to your knees, or at least the tops of your shins. A small coffee table, chair or a bunk are good choices. Your legs should be shoulder width apart, or a little wider. Keeping your legs fairly straight, bend at your hips until your palms are in contact with the object. Tilt forwards slightly so that you can take some of your body’s weight through your hands. This is the start position. Now, with your torso remaining as parallel to the floor as possible, bend at the knees and hips until your hamstrings reach your calves and you cannot go any further. This will require that you bend your arms, also. This is the finish position. Using combined leg and arm power, push yourself up to the start position. Do not raise the heels at any point during the exercise.

### Exercise
For jackknife squats, the torso is angled forwards so that it’s not directly above the legs; as a result, part of the weight is transmitted through the arms. This exercise is about half as difficult as the standard bodyweight full squat (Step 5), and is a great way to prepare the lower body muscles and tendons for later steps. Performed correctly, it will also give beginners the balance and Achilles’ tendon flexibility required to master the bottom position of a full squat.

### Training Goals

| Beginner standard | 1 set | 10 |
| Intermediate standard | 2 sets | 20 |
| Progression standard | 3 sets | 40 |

### Perfecting Your Technique
This exercise is hardest at the very bottom position, where the lower limbs take the majority of the body’s weight. If this is difficult, gradually work to the bottom position by increasing your squatting depth by an inch or so each workout. An alternative method would be to use more arm power to share the load taken by your legs, and help you get out of the bottom position. Try to use less arm strength and rely on the legs more as they become stronger.

Tilt forwards slightly so that you can take some of your body’s weight through your hands.

Bend at the knees and hips until your hamstrings reach your calves and you cannot go any further.

## Supported Squats

work up to 3 sets of 30 then begin the next

### Performance
Stand up straight with the feet shoulder width apart, or slightly wider. Your arms should be out straight and angled down, holding onto a sturdy object higher than your thighs. A desk, robust basin or the back of a chair will do. This is the start position. Slowly lower yourself down by bending at the hips and the knees, keeping your back as straight as possible, until your hamstrings meet your calves and you cannot descend any further. This is the finish position. Pause for a moment, before pushing yourself up using mostly leg power. To take some of the pressure off your legs—particularly in the bottom position—pull yourself up slightly with your arms, by exerting downward force on the object you are holding. Try to keep the arms fairly straight. Your heels should remain flat on the floor throughout the exercise.

### Exercise
Supported squats are the last exercise before the athlete progresses onto half squats. This exercise forms an ideal link between the jackknife squat (where the legs move the majority of the body’s weight) and the half squat (where the legs move virtually all the weight of the body). Supported squats continue adding flexibility and strength to the athlete’s lower limbs. They condition the tendons, ligaments and soft tissues of the knees. They are a good way to continue perfecting form, most importantly the ability to push up from the bottom position using strength alone rather than momentum.

### Training Goals

| Beginner standard | 1 set | 10 |
| Intermediate standard | 2 sets | 15 |
| Progression standard | 3 sets | 30 |

### Perfecting Your Technique
Fine-tuning the amount of leg strength required on this exercise couldn’t be simpler; to make the exercise easier on the lower body, simply use more upper body strength. As you become more comfortable in the bottom position, gradually use less arm strength to assist you in getting back up.

## Half Squats

work up to 2 sets of 50 then begin the next

### Performance
Stand with the feet shoulder width apart, or slightly wider. Don’t keep your feet perfectly in line with one another; allow your toes to point very slightly outwards. Place your hands in a comfortable position—on your hips, chest or shoulders is fine. This is the start position). Now bend at the hips and knees until your knees are angled at ninety degrees, or (in other words) your thighs are parallel to the floor. This is the finish position. You can use a mirror or ask a friend the first few times until your body learns the right depth. Don’t rush the technique, and never bounce; pause in mid-air at the bottom position for a one count before returning to the start position under full muscular control. Keep the back straight throughout the motion, and keep your heels flat on the floor. Your knees should always point in the same direction as your feet; don’t ever allow the knees to “track” inwards as you squat. The outwards angle of your toes will assist you with this.

### Exercise
Half squats are the first step in the squatting series where you are handling your full bodyweight without any assistance. As such, they deserve respect. This exercise will teach you the balance and basic body positioning under gravity that you need to excel at harder forms of squatting. You will also begin to learn the optimum knee and foot positioning for your unique build. The thighs are very powerful in this top position, and for this reason the rep ranges given below are higher than normal. The muscles of your hips and inner thighs in particular will grow stronger as a result of mastering this movement.

### Training Goals

| Beginner standard | 1 set | 8 |
| Intermediate standard | 2 sets | 35 |
| Progression standard | 2 sets | 50 |

### Perfecting Your Technique
If you can’t perform half squats in the style described above, start with quarter squats instead and add an inch of depth every time you can are able.

Don’t keep your feet perfectly in line with one another; allow your toes to point very slightly outwards.

Bend at the hips and knees until your knees are angled at ninety degrees.

## Full Squats

work up to 2 sets of 30 then begin the next

### Performance
Stand tall, with the feet shoulder width apart or a little wider, depending upon your preference. Turn the toes slightly out, and place the arms in a comfortable position. This is the start of the movement. Bend at the hips and knees, keeping the back straight. When your thighs reach approximately parallel to the floor, shift your weight backwards as if you were about to sit down. Continue descending at a controlled speed until the backs of your thighs are resting against your calves. This is the finish position. Pause for a moment before pressing yourself back up with leg strength alone. Your upward motion should be the reverse of your downward motion. Don’t raise the heels, or allow the knees to track inwards.

### Exercise
Full squats are the classic bodyweight leg exercise, used productively the world over for many thousands of years. And not without reason; full squats strengthen the knees, and add power and athleticism to every muscle in the thighs, as well as the glutes, spinal muscles and hips. The entire lower leg is conditioned, including the calves, anterior tibialis (shin muscles), ankles and even the soles of the feet. Full squats help legs retain their youthful vigor.

### Training Goals

| Beginner standard | 1 set | 5 |
| Intermediate standard | 2 sets | 10 |
| Progression standard | 2 sets | 30 |

### Perfecting Your Technique
If you have met the progression standard for half squats, full squats won’t prove much of a problem. Due to leverage, the exercise will be hardest in the bottom position. This will be particularly true for tall people with long femurs (i.e., thigh bones). If you cannot meet the beginner standard, return to doing half squats and slowly add an inch of depth to your technique whenever you get stronger. Don’t rush, and resist the urge to bounce or rock forwards onto your toes. Use pure muscular power, or don’t bother!

Stand tall, with the feet shoulder width apart or a little wider, depending upon your preference.

Continue descending at a controlled speed until the backs of your thighs are resting against your calves.

## Close Squats

work up to 2 sets of 20 then begin the next

### Performance
Stand up straight with your heels together, toes angled out very slightly. Your arms should be straight out in front of your chest. This is the start position. Bend at the knees and hips until your hamstrings are resting on your calves and you can go no further. Your chest will be pressed into your thighs. Do not raise the heels. To prevent yourself from tipping backwards, you may have to flex your shins to pull your toes up so that you ease forwards. Return to the start position using leg power only.

Exercise
Close squats have all the benefits of full squats, but with an amplified effect on the quadriceps. Over time, this exercise really strengthens the knees, shins, and gluteal muscles, tightening up the butt better than any machine.

### Training Goals

| Beginner standard | 1 set | 5 |
| Intermediate standard | 2 sets | 10 |
| Progression standard | 2 sets | 20 |

---

### Perfecting Your Technique
Many trainees who have rushed through the earlier steps often experience problems with the close squat. The biggest problem is the tendency to overbalance and fall back in or near the bottom position. This tendency will be amplified for tall athletes with long thighs. The problem is caused by a lack of strength in the frontal shin muscles, combined with a lack of the correct equilibrium. If you have rushed the series so far, go back to Step 3 and follow the program properly. If you still have problems, go back to the full squat, and bring your feet an inch closer together every time you work out. Keeping your arms straight out in front will help throw your weight forwards. Holding a weight such as a light dumbbell, book or bottle of water in the outstretched hands will also help, but try to avoid this if you can. Some athletes really struggle with this exercise due to their structure. If this is you, completing this step with the heels one hand span apart is acceptable.

Stand up straight with your heels together, toes angled out very slightly.

To prevent yourself from tipping backwards, you may have to flex your shins.

## Uneven Squats

work up to 2 sets of 20 then begin the next

### Performance
Stand up straight with one foot flat on the floor, and another resting firmly on a basketball located approximately one foot length in front of the other foot. The feet should be shoulder width apart or a little wider. Your arms should be out in front of you, directly opposite your chest. This is the start position. Bend at the knees and hips until the back of the thigh of your non-ball leg touches the corresponding calf. You will not be able to descend any further, despite the fact that your ball leg is not compressed as much. This is the finish position. While learning this position, you may tip backwards, so ensure that you have enough clear space behind you just in case. This applies to all deep squatting. Pause briefly, before pushing yourself back up to the start position with both legs. At no point during the exercise should you raise your heel, rock forwards or bounce, despite the fact that you may instinctively want to do these things at first. Use strength.

### Exercise

Uneven squats are the first big step towards mastering unilateral squats. Up until now, the effect of the steps in the squat series has been symmetrical; they have developed both legs equally. In this exercise, the leg on the ball cannot supply much power due to its raised position and the fact that it has to control the ball. The non-ball leg does most of the work, and acquires superior strength while still having enough help to push the athlete out of the difficult bottom position. The balance and coordination are also greatly improved as a result of this exercise.

### Training Goals

| Beginner standard | 1 set | 5 |
| Intermediate standard | 2 sets | 10 |
| Progression standard | 2 sets | 20 |

---

### Perfecting Your Technique
This exercise requires more skill and more strength than the earlier steps. If balancing on the basketball is a problem, use a stable alternative (e.g., three flat bricks) instead. If you still have trouble, use a lower object than the ball (e.g., one brick), and build up the height as you gain confidence and balance.

Stand up straight with one foot flat on the floor, and another resting firmly on a basketball.

Bend at the knees and hips until the back of the thigh of your non-ball leg touches the corresponding calf.

## Half One Leg Squats

work up to 2 sets of 20 then begin the next

### Performance
Stand straight, with one foot flat on the floor, and the other foot up in the air in front of you. Your elevated foot should be at about the level of your opposite thigh, and the leg should be straight, or nearly so. Place your hands out in front of your chest. This is the start position. Bend the hip and knee of the leg which is supporting your bodyweight, until the knee is bent about ninety degrees. This will put your thigh approximately parallel with the floor. At this point, your raised foot should still be some way off the ground. This is the finish position. Pause for a moment under tension, before driving yourself up using the power of your single leg. Keep the back flat and the heel of your supporting leg on the floor at all times.

### Exercise
This exercise is the first full unilateral (one-limbed) movement in the series. It’s an important stage to master, because it teaches the athlete the balance required before full one-leg squats can be attempted. It’s during this exercise that the athlete also begins to learn the skill of holding the nonworking leg above the ground for extended periods. This is not easy, and requires very strong hip flexors, muscles that are weak in most men. Because only one leg is moving the weight of the body, increased leg strength is developed—but only in the top range. For this reason, when the athlete is practicing this exercise, they should always follow it up with an exercise where a full range of motion is required; preferably close squats or uneven squats.

### Training Goals

| Beginner standard | 1 set | 5 |
| Intermediate standard | 2 sets | 10 |
| Progression standard | 2 sets | 20 |

---

### Perfecting Your Technique
This exercise should prove no problem to an athlete who has met the progression standard of uneven squats. If you still find it a challenge, just begin with a shorter range of motion, and gradually add depth over time.

Your elevated foot should be at about the level of your opposite thigh.

Keep the back flat and the heel of your supporting leg on the floor at all times.

## Assisted One Leg Squats

work up to 2 sets of 20 then begin the next

### Performance
Place a basketball to the side of the foot of the leg you are planning to work. Stand up straight with one foot flat on the floor, and the other foot up in the air in front of you, as for half one-leg squats (Step 8). Place the arm corresponding to your raised leg out in front of you, and let your other arm hang by your side. Bend at the hip and knee of your supporting leg until your hamstrings meet your calf, and you cannot go any further. Place your hand firmly on the basketball. This is the finish position. Return to the standing position using mostly leg strength, but press down on the basketball to help you over the first few inches. Keep the heels flat.

### Exercise
The bottom position of any squatting movement is the hardest part, and this is true most of all for one-leg squats. This exercise will help you tackle the lowest position safely, by allowing your arms to help you through the crucial first few inches. This exercise will strengthen the knee ligaments and tendons, and allow the athlete to approach the Master Step—one-leg squats—with confidence. It will also force the hip flexors to work harder to keep the elevated leg higher than in half-one leg squats, and this may take some getting used to. Invest some training time in this important step.

### Training Goals

| Beginner standard | 1 set | 5 |
| Intermediate standard | 2 sets | 10 |
| Progression standard | 2 sets | 20 |

---

### Perfecting Your Technique
If you can’t reach the beginner standard of this exercise, continue your unilateral training but try pressing off an object higher than the basketball. A chair seat or a low coffee table could be good choices. This will free your arms to provide more support over a longer range of motion than is possible when you use a basketball. Once you master the exercise with a higher object, work with progressively smaller objects until you are ready to try the basketball again.


Stand up straight with one foot flat on the floor, and the other foot up in the air in front of you.

Press down on the basketball to help you over the first few inches.

## One Leg Squats

work up to 2 sets of 50 then begin the next

### Performance
Stand tall. Raise one foot in the air, until it is approximately level with your hips. Keep your elevated leg as straight as possible. This will not be too difficult provided you have spent time mastering the previous steps. Place the arms directly out in front of your chest. This is the start position. Bend at the knee and hip of the supporting leg. Control your descent; do not allow yourself to just drop. Descend smoothly, until the back of the thigh of your supporting leg compresses against the calf and you cannot go any further. Your torso will also be tight against your working thigh. This is the finish position. Pause for a count of one, under tension. Push yourself back up to the start position using leg strength alone. There should be no momentum at all. Retain a straight back, hold the elevated foot off the ground, and keep the heels firmly on the floor. Pause at the top, and repeat.

### Exercise
The one-leg squat is the king of all squatting movements—in fact, it is the ultimate lower body exercise, period. It increases strength in the spine, hips, thighs, lower legs and feet, maximizes stamina and vastly improves athleticism. Over time, this exercise will transform skinny legs into pillars of power, complete with steel cord quads, rock-hard glutes and thick, shapely calves. The master of this movement will never lose the spring” in his legs, and will be protected from all kinds of hip ailments and knee injuries.

### Training Goals

| Beginner standard | 1 set | 5 |
| Intermediate standard | 2 sets | 10 |
| Progression standard | 2 sets | 50 |

### Perfecting Your Technique
If you can’t meet the beginner standard of one-leg squats, return to Step 9 (assisted one-leg squats) and use an object slightly smaller than a basketball—three stacked bricks, for example. Keep using progressively smaller objects to push against until you require no support at all.

Keep your elevated leg as straight as possible.

Descend smoothly, until the back of the thigh of your supporting leg compresses against the calf.
